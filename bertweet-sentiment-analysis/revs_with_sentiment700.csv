Peris seems like a really nice guy, and was super accomodating through all the craziness going on in the world. He lessened our workload, and the midterm was really fair considering all the content we went over. He made the final optional and eased the grading scale a bunch, too. His lectures were engaging and funny at times, and he even connected his lectures to some current events, which was interesting. I really enjoyed his approach to the class.  PS he did get in trouble for saying the n-word while reading MLK's Birmingham letter during the George Floyd protests. He obviously shouldn't have done it, and it was hurtful people (esp BIPOC) even though he emphasized that he was saying it for historical context, and not to be malicious.

We had to write I believe five essays about certain topics, but they hardly involved any research and took me maybe two hours each. I think he made the class a bit more bearable for COVID and all tests and quizzes (quizzes were based on reading) were open note, but they were overall easy anyways. He also did a good job of incorporating current events into his lectures, especially since the election fell in the middle of the quarter.

professor name,gender,class name,reviewer name,review grade," Good Class.  Grading is interesting in that it reminded me a bit of high school -- less emphasis on exams, more emphasis on various ""assignments"" spaced out throughout the quarter. One of the assignments is a ""congressional simulation"" in which people make speeches, propose bills, etc. in front of the entire class. In my opinion, some people took this way, way too seriously and it kind of ruined it for others (swearing, arguing, one-uping people by making actual social media profiles of themselves as ""congressmen""). I'm assuming there are people who do this every quarter.  Perris is a great lecturer. Slides are super clear, no BS, he has clearly put a lot of thought into the course. Final exam and midterm were exceptionally straightforward, online, and open note.  In conclusion, this class is unlike normal Pol Sci courses in that your grade isn't based on just a midterm and final. Your grade in this class is based on a variety of quizzes, homework assignments (ie. short papers), your ""simulation"" participation, a small project, and 2 exams -- all of which are graded very fairly. If that sounds good to you, take this class. However, if you don't like the idea of constantly checking in/ participating in one course (ie. you prefer taking 2 tests and getting them over with), then it may be a good idea to avoid this.","POS: 0.565, NEU: 0.344, NEG: 0.092"

I have made it a priority to attend his office hours almost every week. Professor Peris is always very welcoming and makes sure to answer my questions, even if we go over time. In the past, whenever I would attempt to do outside learning on the course material and ask my professor about it, I would get very sparse answers. Professor Peris, on the other hand, welcomes this type of inquiry. Had he not been teaching this class, I could assure you that I would think studying Congress was incredibly mundane. Now, I have decided to apply to different Ph.D. programs because I have realized how fascinating Congress is and how many questions I have left. I have been able to apply so much of the course content to contemporary events, and I have generated so many research questions just from discussing the course content with Professor Peris. He seems to truly care about students' concerns and goes out of his way to hear their feedback. If you are willing to put in the work to get a good grade for the congressional simulation, he will guide you through it and tell you exactly what you need to do to obtain full credit.

If you are a Political Science major, you need to take Peris at least once during your time here. The class was easy, but there is a heavier workload than expected. You must sign up for a survey-taking website, write 4 papers on the experiences and relate it back to course material. In addition, there is no final exam, but you do need to conduct your own survey as a final project. You have to work in a group of 3, and while the professor does not walk you through making charts and graphs and using Google Sheets, he is always available via email if you have any questions or concerns. The other nice thing about this class is that the professor encourages students to speak up and engage in his lecture. This makes the class feel more like a collaborative discussion than a monotone lecture. He starts every class by asking if there's anything in the news to discuss, and students can talk about anything that interests them. Public opinion is a subject that I only knew little about, but after taking this course I have a much better understanding of how important it is for the field I want to go into.

CLASS SYLLABUS: COURSE OBJECTIVEThe course will serve to examine the evolving economic structures and business practices in the contemporary television industry across a broad spectrum of content delivery services, programming genres, participating companies and contributing individuals.Drawing upon the experiences and insights of distinguished industry professionals who will appear as guests and selected readings from academic, popular and trades sources, students will come to understand and appreciate the fundamental histories, change factors, pending issues and speculative projections that are shaping and re-shaping the contemporary television landscape.In doing so, students will learn analytical skills useful for the study of any media marketplace and become more insightful and informed consumers of television content.For students with career aspirations in the entertainment industry, the course seeks to both prepare and inspire them in pursuit of that goal. For students whose futures lie elsewhere, the course seeks to impart upon them analytical, organizational and creative tools and experiences that will enrich and reward them in any post-graduate, occupational or academic pursuit. TA SECTIONAL SEMINARSIn a very late development, the Department has received University approval for the creation of a weekly Teaching Assistant-led “Sectional”, as a means of supporting and amplifying the lecture and reading content of the course and providing an additional resource for the various assignments. As this development came very close to the commencement of the quarter, details regarding its scheduling are TBD. GUEST SPEAKERSThroughout the course, guest speakers from the highest levels of their respective facet of the industry will share their expertise in all areas of television, such as studio operations, made-for- TV movies, television advertising sales, casting, executive producing and “showrunning”, research, reality and non-fiction programming, among many others. These appearances are designed to be both interactive and skewed towards those themes that are explored in our readings and lectures. FTV 184B – Syllabus – Fall 2017Speakers are subject to availability and may – and often do – change at the last minute owing to the unpredictable nature of the business. GRADINGGrading for this course consists of three elements: Class Participation, which includes regular attendance and thoughtful and productive contributions to class discussions, and two group projects—a Midterm Group Research Paper, and a Final Group Paper + Final Individual “Essay- ette”. The grade breakdown is as follows:Class Participation 30%Midterm Project (Parts 1 & 2) 50% Final 20%Please note the somewhat unconventional allocation for grade determination. The greatest value of this course is the information received via lectures and our industry guest appearances -- in particular, the latter. It is extremely important that students attend every session, particularly as the class meets only once a week. Yes, it is unusual that the Mid-term Project should count for so much more than the Final. The reason for that is that is, frankly, the Mid- term Project is more challenging and more work than the Final and that the Mid-term lays the necessary foundation for the Final Project.Because of this unconventional allocation, the schedule for the Mid-term is shifted relative to the norm: The Mid-Term, Part 1 will be due on November 16th (Week 7). The Midterm, Part 2 will be due on November 30th (Week 9). The Final will be during the last regular class session, December 1st.THERE IS NO CLASS ON NOVEMBER 23TH – HAPPY THANKSGIVING ONE AND ALL ASSIGNED READING FTV 184B – Syllabus – Fall 2017       Lotz, Amanda D., ""THE TELEVISION WILL BE REVOLUTIONIZED"", New York: New York University Press, 2nd Edition, 2014 (selected excerpts only – which will be provided periodically)Salkin, Allen, ""FROM SCRATCH : INSIDE THE FOOD NETWORK"", New York : Putnum, 2013 or revised edition, Berkeley Press, 2014.As to the Salkin book, please plan on reading one chapter per week to remain current.

Students will be asked to identify the “pivot point”, justify its selection and provide an explanation of some of the consequences of the pivot.Students will work in groups of 2-3, and each group will profile a different network, both to be determined by random selection.In providing both a guide and context for the identification of “the pivot”, the paper should include some reference to five basic areas of inquiry: Network Ownership and Financial Foundation, Programming Strategy, Marketing Strategy, Program Ownership and Financing, and Signature Show.Please note: Not every one of these questions need be answered in detail in the paper, although most of them will. Consider the following as both a guide for your research as well as a prospective checklist for content.The answer to many of these questions may change as the result of your designation of the respective “pivot point” for your network -- which is precisely the goal of the exercise many relevancies to the course content. I daresay that it might prove to be the most enjoyable reading assignment of any of your classes this quarter.Wolff, Michael, “TELEVISION IS THE NEW TELEVISION: THE UNEXPECTED TRIUMPH OF OLD MEDIA IN THE DIGITAL AGE”, New York: Portfolio/Penguin, 2015A very au courant thesis from one of the wisest and wittiest of our contemporary media sages. Mr. Wolff’s tome will help initiate and provoke some of our most interesting discussions.In addition, there will be various articles or book excerpts on a range of topics handed out each week in class (or sent to the students via PDF).1. Network Ownership and Financial FoundationThis area of inquiry should address, among others, such questions as:a. Who owns the network? Is it part of a conglomerate? Is it a publicly traded company, and if so, how does its ownership affect the type of programming and pressures placed upon the network?b. How does this network fit into the Owner’s overall business strategy?c. What other television interests does the Owner have, and how do they impact thenetwork?d. Where in its lifespan is the network currently? Is it mature, or is it an emergingstartup venture? Is it transitioning into something new, with a new identity?e. What is/are the revenue source(s) for the network? Advertising? Cable systemoperator fees (aka, retransmission fees)? Subscription fees?2. Programming StrategyThis area of inquiry should address the network’s programming objectives and the strategy it is currently using to achieve them. Such questions to pose might include:a. What percentage of programming is original, as opposed to acquired? Is the percentage of original programming increasing?b. What is the target audience these programs endeavor to reach? What is the age, gender, and ethnic breakdown for their audience? Does the programming attempt to evolve the demographic profile over time?c. Is the network’s schedule consistent from night to night, or are there varied strategies employed on different nights?3. Marketing StrategyIn the increasingly crowded and competitive television landscape, networks devote enormous resources towards marketing themselves and their programs. An understanding of a network’s marketing strategy is as critical to the success of a producer’s show as a programming strategy. This area of inquiry might touch upon such topics as:a. Does the network have a “brand,” and if so, how would it be defined?b. From your observations, what is the principal venue for the network’s marketing efforts? Do they use print media, broadcast media, outdoor (i.e. branding at sportsarenas, billboards), or on-air promotional spots—or a combination of these?c. Does the network have an internet presence that is distinctive and complementary?4. Program Ownership and FinancingA critical issue for networks and producers alike relates to the ownership and financing of original programs. This area of inquiry should address such questions as:a. How are the shows financed? (Note: Instructor will assist in directing students to necessary reference source if this question proves frustrating)b. Who owns the show after its network run? Does the producer have the right to distribute the show in other marketplaces, foreign or domestic? Do home video and Video On-Demand services factor into the equation?c. Is the production infrastructure handled in-house at the network or by an outside studio or production company?5. Signature ShowMany networks became household names owing to the prominence of one “signature” show with which the network is closely associated. These shows may help define the “brand” of the network. Identify a show, either scripted or unscripted, that would be representative of the network’s programming strategy, i.e., a “Signature Show” that best illustrates the “Pivot Point”. MIDTERM, PART 23-4 Page Paper Due Week 9 (November 30th, 2017)Working in the same groups as for the Midterm, prepare a short paper that provides a more detailed examination of the show used to illustrate the “Pivot Point”(For those familiar with the series Biography, first made famous on the old A&E Network, this assignment can be likened to researching the “biography” of a television show.)Using 3-4 pages, discuss the following questions:a. Where did the show come from?b. How did it come into being?c. Who thought of it? Who are the producers?d. Is this a pre-existing show or created/developed originally?e. Who directed the pilot? Who wrote the pilot?f. What does the show cost to produce?g. How frequently do episodes air? How many comprise a season?h. How long has the show been on air? How has it evolved over time, both in thequality of the storytelling and of the creative arts (cinematography, production design, lighting, etc.)?FINAL(Inclass. Dependingonhowtheindustryguestscheduleplaysout,theFinalwillbe given either on Week 10, December 7 – Pearl Harbor Day – or during Finals week proper, on December 14).Each student will be assigned a relatively brief (two to three pages) essay that addresses a question derived from one statement in the Amanda Lotz or Michael Wolff assigned textbook. Students will be assigned different questions, which can come from any part of the assignedreading. The essay can be handwritten or typed and emailed in class. P.S.

It can be hard to follow along at times and it's kind of frustrating when you have to decipher what's important to the course, and what's just a personal story of his. A study guide for the exams would've been nice too, but I would say that each week has a specific theme, and the theme as a whole (if quite a bit of time was spent on it) has major potential to appear as an essay question on the exams.","POS: 0.937, NEU: 0.060, NEG: 0.003"

Professor Apter covers key concepts necessary for development studies, such as dependency theory and modernization theory, however his delivery and lectures are in desperate need of clarity and structure. At the beginning of the course, he has powerpoint slides for each lecture, however, midway throughout the quarter he stops presenting from slides and provides no slides, notes, bullets, etc. These lectures were very confusing and essentially just consisted of tangents over tangents that left the class very confused as to what the objectives of the lecture were. There were many times where I had only a few sentences of notes because the majority of the lecture were filled with him rambling about who knows what. He is a nice person, however, as a professor he really needs some sort of structure to his class so students know what they are expected to learn. There was no study guide for the midterm or final so essentially you had to find anything that seemed important enough from the readings or lectures and regurgitate that. Midterm and final were of similar format, with you having to define a few terms out of a small word bank and then 1 essay for the midterm, 2 for the final. Discussions talked about the readings, some of which were important, others not so much. This was a theory-focused course and the readings were quite dense at times. I am highly disappointed with this course and it was my least favorite of the IDS core classes.

In my four years at UCLA, Apter is by far the worst instructor I have ever had and I am actually ashamed to say he is a part of the IDS program. Not only is he a babbling idiot who contributes nothing to helping the world, he regularly hates on all others who dare to go against his socialist beliefs.

However, this class was honestly among the best I have taken at UCLA, and Professor Apter was key to this. This is no means an easy class; a lot of the material in both lectures and readings is pretty dense and requires a lot of thought and concentration, especially since the class is pretty fast-paced. The assessments moreover, though comprising just a midterm and a take-home final, are marked pretty strictly. However, don't be put off! I found Professor Apter to be a wonderful old-school sort of academic, exceptionally knowledgeable whilst also fairly eccentric. The class doesn't feel disorganised as all the lectures are very focused (though he doesn't share his powerpoints afterwards), with clear conclusions and key points summarised at the end. If you don't understand anything, he is very personable and helpful both during class and in office hours. He expects you to be motivated to learn and to be focused during class, but I honestly don't recognise what some of the past reviewers say about him being rude/disorganised/angry etc. He never for example shouted at anyone for coming in late, and was even giving out fistbumps by the end of the quarter. He was also very funny at times, and often had the whole class laughing with him when he recalled his past life researching in Nigeria. We memorably spent a whole class learning about and listening to old African pop music whilst he danced away at the front!  This is the first review I've written, and I only do it to correct what I think is a misleading and unfair image. He is a really good professor, and if you're interested in African history you will get a huge amount out of this class provided you put the work in.","NEU: 0.580, POS: 0.258, NEG: 0.162"

He goes off on side tangents about his ""research"" in Nigeria or about how much he hates republicans. He criticizes international development like it is a joke (clearly to the wrong audience, we are all IDS majors...); and hates on international aid but does not offer any alternatives - if you look up the ""research"" he has done in his career you will see this.  He can't even draw a supply and demand curve (anyone who took this class in Winter of 2015 will tell you that), the most basic principle of economics! That is completely ridiculous and there is no excuse why he should have such a lack of knowledge. And then, of course, he pretends that he knows so much more about economics than we do, and attempts to use fancy words in order to make himself feel smarter than us. He also has this really annoying habit of yelling at people who walk in right AT 9:30 or even at 9:31, because this class is ""the most important one you will ever take and you are being disrespectful by being late"". Well i'd like to see his fat a** walk from Veteran to Public Affairs and see if he got there on time. I learned absolutely nothing of value in this class, and if you have the opportunity to take either of these classes with a different professor, DO IT. His History 16E class was no better (taken Spring 2014). The best part of that class was I enjoyed one of the textbooks he assigned, but that was it.

I am a business/econ major and have an interest in art history as a whole (I took AP art history in Europe and frequent museums and galleries) however I had no previous exposure to african art.  Like others have said, this class does require a lot of memorization, however this is only to be expected with an art history course.   All of the TAs seemed to be very pompous and pretentious, and this reflected in their grading.  The TAs, like many other courses, are the ones who determine your grade, so make sure to stay on your TAs good side and to behave not only in section but lecture as well (many times the TAs would turn around from their front row seats and just glare at people whispering or quietly texting... they're pretty intense).  Also make sure to go to their office hours so you can understand what they exactly want for their papers.   As for Nelson, he is a funny, outgoing guy who seems pretty informed about the topic.  Taking notes in class is important -- just make sure to write down the name of art piece and all of the information Nelson tells you about it so that when you are reviewing for exams you can review your notes easily.  Sometimes lectures do get boring (if you fall asleep in the dark easily then this class is not for you) but my class wasn't too early in the morning so it worked out. The exams weren't difficult for me.  I studied moderately beginning the week before and studied my notecards (picture of the art piece on the front and name of the piece, artist, date, region and description on the back) thoroughly the day prior.  They are pretty time crunched so make sure that you know every piece confidently because it's pretty hard to predict which pieces Nelson will test you on. Overall, I would recommend this class.  It's not THE easiest GE but it definitely doesn't require much brainpower and does require mostly memorization.  Let's just say if you have a good memory, take this course.

Professor Brown provided me with a class that was enjoyable as well as insightful. Each week, he would post a couple of prerecorded lectures or documentaries for us to watch regarding the material for that week. Then, he would use the scheduled class time as a type of office hours, briefly reviewing the material in the first 15-30 minutes before opening it up to questions about anything. He would often draw parallels between earlier periods and today, first with the COVID-19 pandemic and all related economic issues, then the Black Lives Matter and social unrest toward the end of the quarter, which I found rather applicable by bringing history to today. On a side note, he would always begin the lectures with some music in the background that related to the topic of the day, something which I enjoyed. With regards to tests and grades, Professor Brown was more than fair. He said that he ""wished he could give everyone an A,"" which reflects his intentions to try to help everyone understand and succeed in the course. Each of the two midterms was entirely multiple choice and open book, with ample time to answer the questions and double-check with the book before submitting. Rather than a final, he assigned us a final paper which was very fun to write; this was graded by our TAs. Ultimately, because of the political and social unrest toward the tail end of the quarter, Professor Brown made the final paper a no-harm assignment to be accommodating.

Terms like Soul Train, Chaka Khan Disco etc. Overall midterms are doable if you got to lectures. Honestly all readings do not need to be done because they can be repetitive and go into more detail than needed.4)Final paper. 6-8 pages, only 1 mandatory source.

Pay attention to his lectures, and you will be completely fine getting at least a low A on each exam. I did the readings in the beginning, but tbh you can get away with not doing them at all. Discussion (20%):• Participation (10%), Attendance (10%)• Please attend your discussions because they are mandatory lol. However, they're not too bad, if not a little boring because it's basically content review. Prof Alim goes over the material already in zoom + recorded lectures• Participation includes appearing as if you're paying attention to class, as well as weekly 1-2-3 assignments, which are basically reflection on the readings. You can probably just skim each of them and write whatever as long as it's somewhat relevant and coherent. Papers (20%):• 2 papers, 10% each• 1-2 pages long, single-spaced, including citations• It honestly depends on your TA, but all of the readings and Alim guide you toward an answer, and you can kinda ramble as long as you have a point.

I'll start with my one (small) complaint: when I enrolled in the class, there was no indication that lectures would be online and asynchronous. I was a bit disappointed to learn this after the fact, but Alim's lectures proved to be quite interesting and engaging regardless of the fact that they were pre-recorded. However, I do think that in an in-person lecture setting, Alim's great teaching and amazing passion for the subject would be even more inspiring, so I have to say it's somewhat regrettable that we never got to be taught by him in person. Aside from this, Alim does a great job of preparing his students for his exams (he calls them Celebrations of Knowledge""). The tests are online and not proctored, and extremely doable if you review with the study guides/notes that others in the class will make. The only other grades are participation in discussions, which includes a weekly discussion post that is pretty much only graded for completion, and two short (~2 page) essays that were each due a week after the two exams. The first essay did not require any of your own research; you only needed to cite papers that had previously been assigned as weekly readings. For us, Alim decided to make the second essay extra credit, which was likely in part due to the TA strike. I'm sure grading of the essays varied slightly between TA's, but my TA graded very fairly: it seemed like as long as you followed the requirements and showed a decent understanding of the readings, you got full points. The grading structure was 10% for each essay, 10% for participation (5% for discussion attendance and 5% for weekly posts), and 35% for each exam. As far as the content of the course, it has a pretty big focus on African American language, especially in hip hop culture, as that seems to be the subject of the majority of Alim's work. Readings are assigned from other linguistic anthropologists as well as from his own papers and two of his books. The books are considered required texts for the course, but I was able to find a PDF of one and was honestly completely fine without ever purchasing the other. If you have any particular interest in old-school hip hop, I would encourage you even more strongly to take this class with Alim; he has to be one of the more prolific researchers in that niche. The content of the readings can be quite wordy and may require re-reading paragraphs to try and understand them, but I found it not to matter much because Alim's lectures did a great job of highlighting the main points in a much more comprehensible way. Overall, I found the class to be extremely manageable but still stimulating and engaging. I definitely came out of the class with a slightly more informed perspective on the world, despite it not being too challenging at all.","POS: 0.974, NEU: 0.022, NEG: 0.004"

It consisted of 10 online modules you would have to work through over 10 weeks. There were attached readings to the online lectures. The course is heavy in readings, however, a majority of them are quite interesting, and if you at least skim all of them, you will be 100% fine. Make sure you stay on track of the readings, as it just makes the midterm (online) and final (online) easier to work through. Additionally, there are 2 one-page papers where you have to apply the vocab into it (very easy). There are discussion sections, where your TA will go over the readings, so if you don't understand anything in the readings, it is usually explained in these sections. The lectures are prerecorded, however, he does hold one-hour live zoom sessions (not required to attend) that are EXTREMELY useful. He discusses exactly what will be on the online tests on the zoom call, so you know exactly what to study for.  You can really tell that he wants his students to learn and will make you succeed in the class. I highly recommend this class if you want a light GE overall!!","POS: 0.870, NEU: 0.129, NEG: 0.002"

The readings were a little rough at the beginning of the course just because they were pretty theoretical and dense but they're genuinely interesting and you just need to understand the basic ideas. The workload was just the readings and one short weekly writing assignment for section, as well as 2 short papers that you were given at least 4 weeks to write.

I am taking this class as a 1st year English major, and this class is not hard at all. The lectures are recorded, so you just watch them on your own time, do the readings for the week and go to your discussion. Some week's readings are heavier than others, but overall it is manageable. Also, from Alim's lectures, you can see which readings you actually need to do. Alim also hosts a Live Session Zoom each Thursday where he goes over the week's materials and hint at what will be on the ""celebrations."" The ""celebrations"" are your exams; you have one in Week 5 and another one in Week 10. Theses celebrations are multiple-choice and easy. If you do your readings, lectures and attend his Thursday zooms, these two exams will be a piece of cake.  Besides the exams, you have two short papers. Both papers are 1-2 pages (single spaced) and that is including your works cited. The prompts are very straightforward.  If you take this class, just read, watch/go to lectures, attend his Thursday Live Sessions and you will be on your way to an A.  Overall I really like this class, and Alim is amazing. His Zooms on Thursdays are things I look forward too. He always shares what snacks he has during the zoom and even showed us his dogs.  Take this class!!","POS: 0.991, NEU: 0.007, NEG: 0.001"

professor name,gender,class name,reviewer name,review grade,"Pros: The midterm and final are insanely easy. They are online and multiple choice, and the questions are not that hard. That said, disclaimer: I only found them easy because I went to the midterm review session (where he explains most of the questions in depth) and because I went to study sessions organized with the Groupme (for the final, there was no review session, but we were given a study guide, which helped out a lot). Definitely take advantage of the review session, and use the Groupme—this course can be difficult at times, but there will always be people who can explain the concepts in simpler terms, or can help answer questions. The two essay prompts were very easy, although that might depend on your TA. Getting an A in this class is not suuuuuper hard compared to some of the other GE courses. The professor is a fun dude, unfortunately lectures was asynchronous so the only time I got to know him were from the emails he sent and the study session. I didn't really go to office hours, but didn't feel the need to. Prof. Alim was incredibly helpful, and super knowledgeable—much of the material for this course comes from his own research and writing. Cons: The reading. Oh, the reading. To be honest, I did all of the readings, because I was scared of doing bad on the midterm and final. I felt that there were way too many, that they were way too long, and they were written in a terribly academic-languagey way (for people who think about language all the time, some of the authors' language style is so incomprehensible and inaccessible for the average college student. Or maybe that was just me). That said, you probably didn't really have to read through them all, nor do you have to read very carefully, because as I said a lot of it is covered by the review session. I would say that I found the discussion sections not very helpful, but that might just be my section. And finally, I had very little idea of what this class was going to be about, but I thought that the material would be about many different languages and ways of communication. This course focuses heavily on African American English, and a lot other styles are sort of shoehorned in and aren't relevant to the essays at all. That said, overall, the course definitely made me change the way I view language. Overall: If you don't like reading a lot, probably don't take this class. But if you are interested in the topic, and use the resources provided,  it shouldn't be too difficult. Just don't be a tryhard like me.","POS: 0.965, NEU: 0.034, NEG: 0.001"

I took this class as a GE my first quarter at UCLA because I was interested in anthropology and wanted to learn more about it, and now, partially due to this class, I'm double majoring in anthro and bio.  Going into it, I was more expecting to learn about the science of linguistics and how language differs in different societies, but we focused a lot on the power of language and how it reinforces different ideas that people have about each other--which I didn't expect, but found very interesting and important to be aware about.  Expect to hear a lot of words like ""standard language ideology"" and ""cisheteropatriarchy.""  The course focuses a lot on Alim's research on Black Language in CA and Hip Hop in South Africa, and I would've liked to learn more about other cultures, but it was nice to learn about actual research he did.This class was pretty easy.  There are a few readings a week, a few very short papers throughout the course, and a two ""celebrations of learning"" aka exams that are timed multiple choice.

Alim is very passionate about what he teaches, and his lectures are pretty clear.I found this class extremely interesting and I think it should be required for everyone.

He gave us a brief overview of who he was and some of his work and as soon as he told us that he worked side by side Martin Luther King Jr., I already felt great awe to be in his presence. The first thing that ran through my head was, “Wow, this man is a piece of walking history!” When Rev. Lawson showed up to lecture the following week, the atmosphere in the classroom was one of excitement and anxiety to hear this man lecture. I was definitely not disappointed. He is a very wise man and I was honored to have have been thought by him. One of my favorite parts of being able to take this class with such amazing instructors was that we got a first hand account of the Freedom Riders, or Martin Luther King, of the Civil Rights Movement because who better to learn about the accounts than one of the most influential men present at the time. The class turned out a lot better than I expected. Although getting all 20hours of service is a commitment, the events that are available are really great experiences.

professor name,gender,class name,reviewer name,review grade," I think my issue was more about the individual philosophers than the professor himself.  For those purely skimming reviews to figure out whether or not to take him, my one word response would be ""meh"" Content-wise, you're looking at two five page papers (!!!) and an open-note final all worth about a third of the grade each. Fair enough.  The prompts in and of themselves are ridiculously vague and subjective, but over the weeks he explains them in such detail that it won't take you very long to write. The con, however, is that unless you're into philosophy (I'm not), this ain't a walk in the park.  Personally, stuff like Marx and Nietzsche makes me really, really want to go away to my happy place.  By the end of the course, I realized it was much more of a philosophy course than a political theory course (example: possible final essay question - ""what is the nature of reality?""  Not so much the political question).  IF that's your thing, then by all means... I ended up with an A-...no complaints there, especially since I didn't like the material.  Lectures are long and phil-heavy, and somewhat provides insight on readings.  He's super open with students and really welcoming.

He was full of life and knowledge, not only about political science but about so many other aspects in life. The man is not only a genius in political theory, but he is also a psycho analyst who has a tendency of bringing instruments in class to get his ideas across. The breakdown of the class was: 2 essays each worth 30% and the final which was also 30%. I like that because nothing was more or less important than the other. If you do well on the first two essays, the final won't be that intimidating. The essays are reasonable. You might want to cry when you read the first essay prompt, but don't. He explains everything so well for his students that it is really hard to mess up. He basically outlines what your essay should consist of. The final is open books and open notes and consists of two essays. Don't get too excited that's just as dangerous. If you are planning on taking in notes MAKE SURE TO ORGANIZE THE CRAP OUT OF THEM! Label philosophers and the idea they are talking about on each page! If your notes are organized enough the final will basically write it self out. :)  I got an A+ and an A- on my essays and an A- on the final. Ended up with an A in the class. Oh btw... go to discussion even though it is not mandatory so you don't look like a moron when you turn in your paper. There are certain ideas and what not that TAs really clarify, and they have specific preferences that you should follow. My TA was amazing. Absolutely loved her! The main reason I did so well in the class was because of her help. BE PREPARED TO READ! EVERYTHING! You will NOT get by if you just show up to lecture and expect to retain enough detailed information to do well on the essays or the final. Yes, there was a certain point in the class when I wanted to strangle every philosopher that we were going over. Nonetheless, Wolfenstein tries his hardest to make the class/subject enjoyable and he definitely accomplished that. You learn a lot in his class (not only about political science). Yes, I worked my ass of for the A, but I definitely do not regret it. Wolfenstein is by far the best, most caring, most involved, and most challenging professor I have come across at UCLA.

He was endearing (he sometimes brought a guitar to class and sang and played!), enthusiastic, a great teacher and explained everything very well and was absolutely clear on every point. He posted thorough online notes ever week which were pretty in depth for something that was just a summary. There were 2 essays and a final, on which there were 2 essay questions. When some one asked how much writing is expected for each essay question on the final, he just said ""well bring as many blue books as you think you'll need"". I was so exhausted during the final, which i found difficult. However the best part about the final is it is open book! You could bring any notes or books, just not laptop. The first two essays and the final were all 1/3 of the grade. I ended up getting an A-; I'm a PS major and this class was a great introduction to what I was already interested in. My TA was great too, definitely ask for help or guidance on the essays, which your TA will be grading... therefore they'll have a big impact on what your final grade is.

professor name,gender,class name,reviewer name,review grade," I am a Poli Sci major and took this class after being told amazing things about Wolfenstein by a high-school friend who just graduated from UCLA. After taking PS10 with him, I can see why many students think he is so great. Before I get into the class/prof, I will cut to the chase about the GRADE since that is what you are probably most concerned with. I am a freshman who received an A+ in PS 30 and 40 this year. I am praying that I will receive at least an A- in PS 10. The class is by no means easy. I would strongly recommend avoiding PS 10 with Wolfenstein (not sure about the class with other profs) if you plan on taking it only for a GE or to maybe get a ""taste"" of PS. If you fit into one of those categories, go take PS 40 with Schwartz and cruise by with an A+ without trying at all. Like I said, I came into this class knowing it was not going to be easy, and it wasn't. However, even if my GPA suffers because of taking 10 with Wolfenstein, I do not regret my decision. I can say that in my first year at UCLA, I learned the most in Wolfenstein's class and I actually grew as a person. As seen in other reviews, his lectures will inspire you. I know so many people in the class who never attended class because he posted lecture notes with all the relevant facts. But in honesty, if this topic interests you, every lecture will be entertaining. I cannot remember the last time I was so engaged in a class. It is important to note that taking 10 with Wolfenstein is misleading since the class is ""PS 10: Intro to Political Theory."" My best friend at UCLA took Philosophy 6 this quarter (Intro to Political Philosophy) and I will say that PS 10 is way more of a philosophy course. If you are looking for a PS class that will analyze the structures of government and reasons for their existence, PS 10 with Wolfenstein is probably not for you. He takes the works of political theorists (Plato, Marx, Locke, and Nietzsche) to an entirely higher level. In short, this class includes ontological, metaphysical, and epistemological ideas that receive equal weight to issues you would expect to receive more focus, such as the origin of the state, nature of justice, and notions of freedom.  I think PS 10 not being what I expected it to be is why I enjoyed it so much. I cannot stress enough that I have not experienced ""learning"" like this in a formal setting for a very long time. Wolfenstein's lectures provoked many thoughts in me that I actually delved into randomly. If you have any serious interest in trying to get a better understanding of how humans act by nature and such consequences of that nature, I seriously recommend this course. Taking it at the same time as PS 30 gave me an amazing educational experience this quarter (not to sound cheesy). But seriously, ending my spring quarter by trying to tie all these philosophical theories together into one ""big picture"" made me feel like I am leaving UCLA this summer on a better off note than when I arrived here.","POS: 0.852, NEU: 0.134, NEG: 0.013"
professor name,gender,class name,reviewer name,review grade," Professor Wolfenstein was very intriguing. In this class you cannot just show up expecting a lecture he goes old school by actually expecting students to have read the books; considered their own opinions; considered alternate opinions; and to engage in discussions amongst each other!! With that said, there are not wrong ideas everyone who gave their input was respected and able to develop within the safety of the class. There were very interesting thoughts and proposed solutions amid these difficult and emotionally provoking stories.  Advice: Read the books, check out the cliff notes, ask questions and let yourself enjoy the class. I got an A, and I admit I missed a lot of the class.

Her lectures are really in depth, so it is important to do the readings  before hand that she assigns and GO TO OFFICE HOURS. Sometimes the class is too big, so she can't answer all the students questions, so office hours is a great chance to meet with her one on one, and talk to her about the questions you might have about the course and the best way to approach the class. There are readings, but as long as you read, she will do the rest and show you what is important. Because it was a GE for me, I was nervous coming in not knowing a single thing about Black Intellectual thought, but she knows that; that is why asking questions on the things you don't understand is important. I really hope this helps. With regards to grading, which most students are concerned about whenever they take a GE Course, it is important to understand her lectures and do the readings, and if you have questions to go to office hours, and the grade will show. She is actually not that hard of a grader, even though you might have a different  answer to her question, as long as you use what she has told you and give evidence and proof to support your answer, you will be great!

I enjoyed the class because Streeter brought in her mastery of English and a feminist critique to the course material. Reading the assigned books helps you to lay a framework for the concepts discussed in lecture. The lecture compliments the readings by giving context to the social and historical realities of the particular time period, it is not simply a review of what we read. So, it definitely behooves you to attend lecture. If you have a background in African- American Studies, you will absolutely love this course.If you aren't so familiar with African- American Studies or history, that is fine too because Professor Streeter is really dedicated to making sure students understand the material.

I got by without reading more than a chapter of each, as the first two books are on Sparknotes/Cliffsnotes and the rest you can find as pdfs or just buy hard copies. The lectures were sometimes useful before Week 6: she would drop quotes with specific page numbers from the first three books with the page numbers, and you could just use them on the 2-page papers and the midterm, which was a few short response and one three-page essay. After that, though, the lectures became propagandist and mostly irrelevant to the final, which was two 4-page essays connecting the last four books (she reuses Ida B. Wells from the midterm), as well as an additional 3-page essay you could write for 5% extra credit, all of which were due on Wednesday of finals week. I did fine just pulling a couple random relevant quotes from each book and tying them all together. (One tip for my TA: insert a sentence or two of fluff after every quote, even if it's background info, because she said that shows her that you actually did the reading.)","NEU: 0.716, NEG: 0.274, POS: 0.010"

He's late coming to class's (not always bad) and he's also late at posting grades (well, it was a lot of grading).  Lecture is just popping out terms, one after another. Get those terms down for midterms and finals, or have get them for you. Sadly, because the class is just terms, the professor doesn't have a lot of time to get into interesting concepts. Skim through the textbook before class if you want to have an idea of what you'll hear in lecture, but not everything in the textbook will come up in lecture, and thus not in the midterm/finals. There was a supplemental book, but it only came up in discussions and references in lecture, but its content did not come up in the midterm/finals, so I would say skim that as well. Oh, and discussion is mandatory, so go there and please don't be one of those silent, dead students.  Midterm and finals consisted of 15 multiple choice, 5 short response, and one essay prompt (out of two). One or two of the multiple choice questions do come from the textbook, but if you study the lecture well, you have a good chance to get them. Essays are graded leniently I think.  Now, the 12 page research paper wasn't as bad as it first came up to be. I did write the paper overnight, but I started gathering data (online surveys) 2-3 weeks before hand. The research paper is not that hard if you choose a topic that interests you, and you can pretty much choose anything. Grading on the papers depend on your T.A., and I'm sure they graded leniently because it's only Sociology 1.  Overall, it's a doable G.E.","POS: 0.713, NEU: 0.229, NEG: 0.058"

This was incredibly slow and frustrating, as he could have easily saved everybody a crapload of time by putting together a Powerpoint presentation, or even making handouts.

Additionally, he likes to ask an abstract question to the class, shoot down about five students' answers, and then finally tell you the answer he was ""looking for""... again, a colossal waste of time that could have been better spent.Aside from lectures, the paper is pretty easy as long as you start EARLY.

For lectures: It was extremely hard to follow along in lectures, because not only does she use outdated language (ex. 'the Blacks were very upset by..) but the presentation slides used were overall non-cohesive and unclear. Essentially, she is repeating everything from the reading. Attendance is occasionally checked.  Reading: I would say do as much of the reading as you can leading up to the midterm, but then after that, you can focus on the material pertaining to your paper. Fortunately, the reading topics themselves are clear and engaging, and I did get a more in-depth perspective of the LA riots (the book that she wrote.)

My friend who previously had him and informed me that he yells during his lecture... boy was that an understatement. I am really glad that I did take this class though because my low expectations were definitely overturned by reality. Comm 175 is a once a week, 3 hour-long class and yes it IS a long time but Von Blum makes it go by relatively quickly. It is difficult to fall asleep in this class (often, at least) because his lecturing technique is to scream at students, but not in a negative, frightening way.  The class is about criticism of the arts (paintings, novels, films) and there are no exams. There are 2 papers that count as the midterm and the final. Each paper is 6-7 pages in length and grammar is VERY important. There is a short 5 question quiz on the last day of class and if you paid attention and took decent notes, it's really not difficult.  Von Blum really makes you think about social issues. He is passionate about teaching and very approachable. You definitely see his liberal views and even if you don't agree with those kinds of views, he at least causes you to think about ethical issues involved in arts, regardless of the political affiliation.

I found his many of lectures to be pretty useless, and it was often hard to focus because he would lecture for the entire 2 hours and 50 minutes other than a short break. He loved to repeat the same line over and over: ""I hate racism! I hate sexism! I hate homophobia!"" which I thought was cool of him at first but weird after he did it so many times, like he thought it was a hot take somehow.  As for the class itself, you have to watch a movie every week, and there are 2 6-7 page papers and a short final. The final is super easy, I didn't study for it at all. I found a lot of the films he chose to be pretty boring or just odd choices in general with all the options available to him. We also had to use Packpack every week which was really tedious and the grading criteria was not clear at all. I also found section to be unhelpful since the class was already discussion-based, but attendance was required. My TA Micah would assign additional films for us to watch which was kind of unfair because the other TA never did for his students.

You don't have to wait long for him to tell you all of them! He is an incredibly vain and self-centered man. The entire course was possibly the easiest, most uncontroversial educational experience I've ever had. The information expressed regarding racism and other forms of bigotry in world history was stuff you might learn in 2 weeks in high school. Very disappointed in the academic rigor from such a prestigious university.  Aside from the hollowness of the course content and the highschool level assignments, we also have to deal with the many quirks of the Professor and his groupies (communications or history majors who hang on his every word, following him from class to class). The political statements he made in class were tired and lazy. He spoke often of his belief in academic freedom (which I appreciate) but discouraged many students who differed in opinion than him by his aggressive demeanor. But, being within a political minority on campus, I am used to challenging the quasi-fascistic shouting down of competing beliefs. I was one of the few who would challenge his idealogy, and his foul-tempered troglodytes wasted no time in being triggered by dissenting opinion.   Take Von Blum's classes if you wish to be inundated further into the matrix by the political machine that is UCLA. The violent and disgusting neo-marxism expressed by him and his loyal followers is what is wrong with the education system at large.

The class is supposed to be about political and grass-roots protest movements in the US (The Farmer's Alliance, Cesar Chavez, the Civil Rights Movement, Gay and Lesbian struggles and all that) but in the end it's only a soapbox for the lecturer to get up on and scream (literally) about how we have become so complacent and how no one agitates for change anymore.  And to make matters worse, he says the first day of class something to the tune of  ""Feel free to disagree with me but I will only be presenting MY personal views on these issues and I will not be giving the counterarguments to anything we're studying"".  What the freak is that??  Personally I think it's the job of a professor to present BOTH sides of an argument so that the students can decide for themselves which side they choose to take, not to brainwash the students through powerful speaking into following him and his dogma like cattle.

I'm coming from a hardcore STEM  major so take that with a grain of salt.My largest set of gripes with this class are all logistical. The final format was confirmed in Week 10, and we were never given a hint it would be an essay, which was frustrating, to say the least.

His grading scheme was kinder to those in the low B to C ranges, but that doesn't mean that being told Wednesday Week 10 that you need a 95 for an A is pleasant. The Prof never sent us an email until Week 10, which was just weird. He didn't release the reading list in a timely manner at the beginning, which meant some people were forced into doing essay options 2 and 3 because their books weren't arriving in time. Some people had alternating TA's grading essays, some had both from either the harder or easier TA, a lack of grading consistency from paper to paper. Just lots of small things that made it hard to feel secure in this class. The assignment breakdown was to pick 2/3 essays to write and turn in. The final was to pick 10/15 terms to ID with a who, what, when, where, why, and then an essay with no citations required, just make your case type of essay. I cranked out 1491 and the textbook at the very beginning of the quarter, only taking notes (google doc with pages listed) for the textbook. I think that was invaluable in not needing to spend as much time on essays later in the quarter. I wish I had done the first two essays, but the election derailed those plans.  For each essay, I read the relevant book the day before (didn't take great notes as I prefer to paraphrase rather than quote) and then combed through the book while writing my essay from 10 p.m. to about 7 a.m. before the 10 a.m. deadline. This meant that besides the first week, I probably only spent like 14 hours total on each essay, which in my opinion, is pretty low compared to other classes' assignments. That being said, the grading is a crapshoot. They are sticklers for grammar, but Grammarly premium meant I didn't ever get a grammar comment, so apparently not too picky. My biggest gripe is I got 23/25 on both my essays, but absolutely no comments on how to improve for the next essay. There's no rubric or advice provided, which was frustrating. Not sure it will help, but our TA's were Zavardino and Marissa Jenrich. Everyone said Zav was a very harsh grader, but he treated me well.  The final was fine, with a 50/50 very possible for the terms, but that section took longer than expected. For the essay, I got a 24/25, meaning I scraped an A with not a point to spare.

His lectures were extremely boring and monotone and seemed recycled. We never got to meet him even once, even after requests for one. Overall, my reading and studying for hours got me an A- because an A in his class was a minimum of 95%, which is too high. The grading was inconsistent, as one TA gave me a 23/25 with lots of feedback and the second TA gave me 22/25 with no comments on how to improve. This same TA gave me a 46/50 on the final with no comments either. Overall, it seems like no one in this class can get an A+, let alone an A.","NEG: 0.955, NEU: 0.041, POS: 0.004"
professor name,gender,class name,reviewer name,review grade," I took the class asynchronous during Fall '20, so your mileage may vary. I hear he is amazing in person and it's not that he was bad online, but he certainly didn't live up to the hype of the reviews from the previous years. That's my fault though for putting too much faith in reviews that don't even apply to online learning. I did have a problem with the communication in the class, though, primarily from the TAs. Asynchronous is not synonymous with ""never send out more than one or two emails throughout the quarter.""  Readings were doable and actually incredibly interesting. I typically find US history super boring but the material never ceased to amaze me. In that sense, the class extremely eye-opening. You just have to make sure to get ahead if you like to really pick apart what you read because you'd typically get two weeks to read each book (anywhere from 150-250 pages total). You'd then write two essays (out of three prompt options) which were five pages each. I know people only read the books applicable to their essays, and while it's possible, I wouldn't recommend doing it looking back because content from all four books was on the final.  The lectures are a bit of a different story. I really love the way he lectures, but I'm not entirely sure how useful they are beyond just consolidating what you read in the textbook and required readings. If your eyes glaze over and you have trouble retaining information in denser literature, then the lectures are perfect. But don't expect your knowledge of the course material to be derived from the lectures. You'll mostly learn from the readings.","NEU: 0.572, NEG: 0.284, POS: 0.144"

He doesn't post his slides so you have to go to lecture, but his lectures are very interesting. On the first day of class, he'll give 3 essay prompts that will be due later in the quarter. You only have to choose 2 out of the 3. If you go to the history writing center and have them stamp your paper, you get extra points on your paper. There are a couple of books that you need because you'll use these for the citations in your papers. However they're all on reserve in the libraries, so you don't have to buy all of them if you don't want to. The final will be 10 identification and a short essay. All of this will be given before the final so you can prepare everything ahead. He'll give you about 50 identification to memorize (who, what, where, when, and why).

I found the lectures really informative. Although you don't really need to watch them for the essays, Madley promoted the critical thinking that will help when writing the essay. Definitely give them a listen! Because of the circumstances of this quarter, the final was made optional, so I can't give input on the contents of it.  There are four essay prompts, spaced out every two weeks. You are required to submit 2, and they make up 50% of your grade. Don't do what I did and wait until the last two to start... way too stressful, although its manageable with the amount of material you're given. I felt that my TA was great for grading these.  He was clear with the expectations for the essays, and he actually sent back edits and suggestions! The required readings include a textbook and a few books, as well as some documentaries. You need to cite from these readings for the essays. Each essay prompt has the sources you can/need to use, so I found it helpful to read and watch with the intention of doing the essay. Ultimately, if you aren't doing the essay for those sources, you don't need to read the books/chapters for that week, although I found them interesting.

A real strength of Madley's was how he so delicately and respectfully gave voice to the histories of American Indian peoples. We covered some horrendous and horrific events but I never felt uncomfortable, just saddened or sorrowful. The material was also presented in a neutral and educational way. I appreciated how we as students were respected enough to not need to be ""convinced"" to believe a certain viewpoint.  In terms of the course materials, the readings were as expected for an upper division history course and the essays assignments were clear and doable. This made it possible to really be present in lectures instead of worrying about little assignments or due dates.

Detailed as they are, you really don't need to take extensive notes. I wish I didn't; I would have paid closer attention to the actual material. Madley is also very aware that he is a white man lecturing about ethnic studies, and I personally think he demonstrated his expertise with the utmost respect. There is no midterm, and for the final he will give you a very comprehensive study guide. The two papers are graded very generously. As long as you show that you put effort into research and writing, you will get an A. There is a lot of assigned reading for the course, but if you are short on time I would recommend that you only read the books pertinent to the two essays you choose (out of four total options) that will be provided in the syllabus.

Yet, I'm glad I took this course with professor Madley, because I learned so much and he is probably one the best professors I've taken since transferring to UCLA. His course consists of reading six books, two essays, and the final exam. You'll be given three essay prompts, but you only have to choose two. All three essay prompts ask for five page papers. I did the first two since we only had two weeks between each essay and it gave me a grace period during week nine to study for finals. The first essay was due during week five, the second was due week seven, and the third essay was due week nine. In general, your grade consists of the two essays, which are worth twenty-five points each and the final which was worth fifty points. The final was another five page paper worth twenty-five points and the other twenty-five was identifying terms (who, what, when, where, why). The terms took a little more time than usual as he gave us sixty-five terms on the final study sheet and he only chose fifteen to put on the exam. However, you'll only have to identify ten out of those fifteen terms on the exam. This class was a little more reading than I  expected, but I'm glad he chose interesting reads as week eight you'll be instructed to read over 350 to 400 pages in a single week. As mentioned, the readings are six books ranging from 100 to 450 pages. Make sure you set aside time in your schedule for the readings. Especially if your other classes have dense reading assignments. It was most helpful to take notes and annotate during the readings for the essays, which helped me from having to continually look back in the books for important points for my essays. All your papers and final are graded by TA's and I would recommend you drop in during their office hours to speak with them to get a general idea of what they'll be looking for in your papers. Our TA's were Zavardino and Munoz. I would say the former was a little more forgiving than the latter, but they are both stringent about how concise your thesis is structured, how you provide backup evidence from the readings in your argument, and the accuracy of your argument. The first paper I did not go to the writing center and I got a 21/25. The second paper, I did go to the writing center and got 23/25. So if you have time it might help to go by the writing center and get a second opinion on your paper. Professor Madley's lectures are some of the best I've encountered from a history professor, both at community college and UCLA. His research is in the study of California Indians, but his general knowledge of American Indians is the most in-depth and impressive. I learned so much more about the American Indian during the American conquest than I originally thought I knew. In all honesty, I'm so disappointed that I did not get to experience this class in person and I'm sure his in-class experience is that much more intellectually gratifying.

You can't use an older version because the lineup of lecturers changes every quarter. I ended up borrowing the course reader every few weeks from a friend taking the class with me to stay on top of the readings.

Definitely very passionate about American Indian Studies, but his lectures tended to be slightly unfocused because of how enthused he is. For the F11 quarter, he had a guest lecturer almost every week, and on the one hand, it introduced a lot of varying and interesting POVs, but on the other, some lecturers were very dry, others were clearly used to teaching at a graduate level and had no idea what a GE meant, and there were one or two that the TAs later told us were completely wrong in some of their points. If you want to maximize your time, skip lectures with heavy reading (particularly those about history or law, as the details are always covered in the reading excerpts) and attend those based on media, such as movies or music, or culture/cultural events, as those will be referenced later in discussion, and pictures shown during presentation may show up on the midterm/final. The TAs made sure to get the main points of ever lecture across at discussion, however, and so long as you wrote those vocab words down you were pretty much set for the IDs/short answer sections on the tests. Study guides were provided for both the midterm and final, and the TAs made sure to emphasize a handful out of all the readings that would most benefit us to re-read. Attendance to section was almost always taken. The midterm consisted of a response paper to a reading and a multiple-choice exam with some IDs. The TAs very unwisely decided to curve the grades by section, so when one section didn’t get a curve they rightfully argued against the other section receiving one, and so some grades were dropped substantially as a result. We received short notice of a quiz worth 15% of our grade the day before it was held, and it seemed like a good chunk of people did poorly because of how late it was announced. There were, however, a LOT of extra credit opportunities, both on and off campus. The reader was well over $100 and close to 800 pages, cut up into two books. Obviously a lot of reading, some of which is incredibly uninteresting, and some readings (such as Native American fiction), while being engaging, won’t ever appear on a test. The guest lecturers also select the readings, so there’s a good chance that your reader won't be completely the same as next quarter's, so it’s best to buy and share a copy and split the cost rather than try to sell it off to someone later. I got a solid A in this class while skipping quite a few of the lectures (at random) or sleeping through others, not doing any extra credit whatsoever, barely participating in discussion, and writing my own study guides based off the TA’s, with no study buddies. Definitely possible to go it alone and do fine, but not doing the readings will hurt you. At least TRY to read most of them – knowing the main ones cold will definitely go a long way on the tests.  I wouldn’t really recommend this GE in particular as “fun,” though it is pretty easy overall. It is at least halfway interesting part of the time, and even if it’s really boring, the historical portions, if you can stand to stay awake through them, will be incredibly enlightening. You’ll probably at least be a bit more sensitive to Indian/Native American stereotypes that are so commonplace in everyday life, so hopefully you’ll make it out a slightly more wholesome person for your trouble.","NEU: 0.791, POS: 0.147, NEG: 0.063"

His manner of speaking is very engaging, and his many guest lecturers are truly experts in their fields, and interesting to listen to. In no way is he trying to trick you with his tests (he even tells us this), they're pretty straightforward so long as you do the reading--quite a bit I might add, but you're tested on main ideas stressed repeatedly (you're also told what you need to know, so no worries about that). The only thing was that the course reader was rather pricey; but the syllabus tells you every reading you'll have, so why not save $100+ and borrow books from the libraries on campus--Powell and YRL? (or order in advance through Interlibrary Loans?) Many of the shorter articles are online (search through the UCLA Library website); for obscure pieces not found, you can always go to the Am Ind library in Campbell for help :) . Got an A+ having done less work relative to my upper div Biochem classes, and gained insight into a unique culture.

This class is taught solely by guest lectures and she adds her insight in at the very end (usually a 1 minute statement); although she did conduct the last lecture. Class Breakdown: Lecture Quizzes: You are assigned a short quiz on the course website – usually 4-5 multiple choice/true or false/fill in the blank/short answer questions (mostly multiple choice) questions. The quiz is based off of the readings before each lecture. They are easy. They are graded on a very unique curve that essentially guarantees you an A on them. You are given until the beginning of lecture to take the quiz. Lecture/Essays: Each lecture is based off of a different topic in American Indian Studies. At the end of the set period you are assigned an essay and are to find and discuss the common theme of the series of lectures. These are your only major assignments in the class; you have 3 essays during the quarter. For the last essay we were given the option of doing whatever format we wanted. It had to be in a 3-6 page format. It was really creative. I made a syllabus and got 100% on it! The other essays are graded solely off the way your TA grades and the grading rubric. Discussion: You have weekly discussion with your TA. I had Lawrence Mojado – he was really cool and very helpful. Discussion is mandatory and attendance is taken. This counts as 60 points towards your grade. Grade Breakdown:Quizzes: 34 points (2 points per quiz and you take 17 of them)Papers: 126 points (First 2 essays are 43 points and the last is 40 points)Discussion: 60 points (Just show up to discussion and earn these easy points!!)Total: 220 maximum points Overall the class was very simple.

She starts the class by showing some slides, and then she switches to showing films and having guest speakers. While she put some effort into picking the guest speakers, they did not help at all. They were just wasted time to fill in the time for the class. The lecture slides were also not very helpful, the only part you should pay attention to is when she talks about hegemony. The readings for the class are extremely important. Thankfully, she has most of them on reserve in Powell.  I got away with missing about 4 lectures and still managed to get an A.

The tests are multiple choice, and if you've gone to lecture and taken really good notes you can get almost everything. The class has a few underlying themes (language in context vs. language in text), and if you figure them out, the questions all fall into place; skip lecture and your screwed, b/c the readings are too complicated to get out the info needed to succeed. The projects for the class aren't bad, and if you just complete what's asked, you're already at a B+. Prof. Kroskrity curves at an A-; that's right! Be above average and you have an A.

Kroskrity and his absolutely dreadful way of lecture (I started to realize I was noticing and JOTTING DOWN the ""ah, um, aaaaah"", yes, all in one sentence and about everyother sentence, sequences in his broken speech he was belting out every 20 seconds or so more than what he was talking about.  For a linguist he sure has a hard time speaking clearly and to the point.)  only makes you go even more insane.  Out of the ocean of material you have to go through he gives lectures on powerpoint that are, truthfully, three to four sentences long and really make very little sense.  When asked, as he was a few times at the begining, to clarify something he would abruptly and somewhat gruffly tell them to read the text (despite I and others who talked about it later had read the text and had the same questions).  He did not answer any questions in this regard, not one.  He is not helpful.  So, with the huge and complex articles and the three to four sentence explanations you are given a test that is extremely detail specific and often seemed to come from some abstract part of the text or some brief, momentary mention of an example he gave.  There is of course no review for exams and with all the readings it is daunting to try and take it all in for a test.    His tangents, as others described go on and on and seem to have little to do with the material and are done, as is the explanation of the little he does go over, in such a way that one would think he was giving the lecture to a linguistics graduate class.  There were terms upon terms, concepts and ideas, that I had not the slighest notion of and during a regular quarter it may have been possible to research but during a five week course???  He doesn't seem to understand that this is a GE undergrad course.

If you go to all the enrichment sections and write a simple 6-page paper, you get another 2 points!  I only answered the questions of the morning but got an A anyways.

Her lectures are lively and will keep you up at 8am, but I don't find them necessary.  She has 3x 40 question mc midterms, two of which are during the quarter and one of which is coupled with the final.  You can drop one of your midterm scores.  Just read the book and go to enrichment sections to find out the main concepts that you'll be tested on.  I can't say that her tests are really easy (except for the first, which was a joke), but if you go over the material so that you know the answer to the question before you read the options, then you'll do great.  I recommend knowing the characteristic symptoms, causes and treatments for each disorder (forget about age of onset, prevalance, etc).  Know the drugs, know the neurotransmitters.

professor name,gender,class name,reviewer name,review grade," Professor Mays is one of the WORST professors, by far, at UCLA, if not the entire UC system. She preaches equitable accommodations and resources, but ENSURES that her course was taught with an unequal and unfair disadvantage to her students, as well as with her unprofessionalism and her mocking of her students. She claims she shares positions on multiple committees - of which I question their reputability in anointing her a position - but never once treated this course and her students with the respect she demands for herself. I was thoroughly interested in the field of study the course aimed to educate, but after a quarter with Professor Mays, I can eagerly and most sincerely say that I will never take a course taught by her EVER again, no matter how interesting the course may be. Professor Mays has not yet ONCE (EVER) read her course evaluations - her being tenured only makes her a worse example of how poorly trained some educators truly are. She is an example of an abuse of power, and an individual who shares no respect for her students AND her teaching assistant. Shelby was the ONLY source of compassion and understanding this quarter, yet was treated with disrespect the ENTIRE quarter. I believe Shelby was mentally and emotionally strained this quarter, and it had to do with how Professor Mays treated her and this course. I understand my voice as a student will not be heard, but if this does reach individuals and committees of power, do INVESTIGATE PROFESSOR MAYS - she does NOT deserve her role as an educator here at UCLA. If you do read this, DO NOT take this class with Professor Mays. Before taking this class, I did read the BruinWalk reviews and very ignorantly ignored my peers. Professor Mays is everything her reviews say she is - none of these reviews are exaggerations. I do believe taking this class remotely with the current state of the world made this class and this professor all the more WORSE. She was NOT understanding. After the final ""midterm,"" one week before the final exam, approximately 90 students remained in the Zoom meeting to voice their concerns about her offering an optional or no-harm final - to which she mocked us and claimed that she had no power in altering HER already-flawed syllabus to which she failed to abide to throughout the quarter.

I truly cannot believe how she receives such prestigious positions and awards. I hope that higher-ups at UCLA eventually see student reviews and and look into her as an educator. If she is an exceptional researcher and provides value in these university positions, fine - but she has absolutely NO place educating undergraduate students.  I will say first that I don't regret taking the class because I am very interested in the material and I gained value from doing the weekly assigned reading. I also didn't think the class was super difficult. PROCEED WITH CAUTION though when choosing to take this class because the reviews below are true - you will be putting yourself through a bunch of nonsense in order to get access to some interesting articles.  That said, Professor Mays is a worse educator than any high school or middle school teacher I ever had - not an exaggeration. All she does is show hundreds of slides with 0 organization and then ramble for an hour. Then, to assess you, she gives poorly-written 10-question multiple choice exams that do not assess your true understanding of the material. SHE NEEDS TO STICK TO RESEARCH. Especially at a school like UCLA, students deserve better.  She's also the rudest professor I ever had experience with in my 4 years at UCLA. I don't know if all of the recognition for her work has gone to her head or what, but she is self-centered and arrogant. She is rude and dismissive to students.

professor name,gender,class name,reviewer name,review grade," I took this course because of a genuine interest in race-based health disparities, and although the content of this class met my expectations and I learned a lot of practical and interesting concepts, I would not take this class again because of the environment and confusion that Dr. Mays created. The class is a ""point system"" in which there are two 20 point midterms, a 30 point cumulative final, 5 point weekly summaries that add up to 30 points, and a potential for 2 points of extra credit through questions of the day.  The two midterms are 20 questions each, so each question is theoretically worth 1% of your grade. After our first midterm, she asked for student feedback, so we all asked for more questions on the tests because the test was manageable to complete in the time period and we felt that it was very difficult to show what we learned in just 20 questions, to which she responded that ""that wasn't actually what we wanted."" Around this same time, Dr. Mays gave us the option to drop a midterm score, which shows that she doesn't understand her own point system, because since it is not on a distribution scale, we would just be losing an opportunity to gain more points. The second midterm occurs in WEEK 10, in addition to the final during finals week. The tests themselves are supposed to be an equal distribution between slides and readings, which I would say was the case. However, they are extremely application-based, so you are asked questions on case-study vignettes, and it's often confusing which part of the course each question is alluding to, and since there are so many different sources each week that overlapped in content, it was impossible to know which reading she was testing on. The weekly summaries aren't a bad idea because it makes sure that students do the weekly reading (which I did find worthwhile), but this class somehow found a way to make them difficult. You are required to submit 6 out of 9 weeks and are able to do more if you don't get full points on a summary, but they are extremely time consuming since there are at least 5 sources each week and the summary itself has to be 500 words. I often got 4.9/5 points for apparently no reason, but the most frustrating part is that they are due at noon on Sunday, which is hard for students like me that have a lot of commitments outside of school. I would understand midnight on Saturday or Sunday, but this deadline seemed arbitrary and somewhat unfair.   The TAs offer Q&A sessions before each exam (not review sessions), but Dr. Mays attends and is almost intolerant when students don't understand something , which makes this class really discouraging. Overall communication was messy and incohesive, especially when dictating grades - days would pass after when they said they were going to be posted.  There were supposed to be ten questions of the day throughout the quarter that took place in the first few minutes of lecture, and if you got nine of the ten right, you grade would move up to the next letter grade if you were within two points of it (so if you had an 88 in the course, you could be moved up to a 90). It was week nine and we had done maybe four of them. When we asked if the test questions would be like the questions of the day, they said no... so it didn't make sense why we were doing them if they weren't preparing us for anything. The slides are posted, but I really wish this class was podcasted because the slides do not at all translate into the exam material. Basically, this class is extremely unorganized and unreceptive to student feedback, and I really wish this wasn't the case because the content itself is worth learning.","NEU: 0.663, POS: 0.219, NEG: 0.118"

Do not think this is an easy class and rely on common sense. You will learn a lot of new or very specific information that will definitely be applied in the exams. Even if the professor didn't finish going over the slides, you were responsible for understanding the material. Also, the poor grammar of the exam questions was so distracting. Approaching the professor or TA for help was also challenging because the professor would often be passive-aggressive and both our former and new TA were limited in how much they could help us. So the review sessions they hosted were basically a Q&A with no use of slides or a study guide. The Q&A sessions were always in-person/live on Zoom and never recorded for those who couldn't make it. I don't think it's fair for people who have other obligations and didn't plan for random review sessions not already stated in the syllabus. I noticed the class size visibly shrank after the first midterm. Other than that, I am glad I managed to succeed despite the circumstances.  TL;DR: Don't take this class if you aren't used to bluntness in academia and exams with really bad errors and grammar.

As a disclaimer, I received an A+ in 130 (grades aren't out for CM101A yet, but I expect to have at least an A), did relatively less work compared to my science classes, and have always loved Ancient Egypt.     For 130, scoring well on the quizzes by knowing details of deities and historical facts is a must.  Dr. Waraksa was fairly forgiving when it came to spelling errors (but it's best not to rely on this -- just learn the material properly from the outset).  Her TAs were also pretty generous with points on the exam (compared to my science classes, they didn't take points off for incorrect answers).  Dr. Waraksa also has extra credit identifications on her exams so if you went through the study guide thoroughly you are in good shape. As for CM101A, there is a lot of material to learn with respect to the architecture and themes presented.  The class consists of 1 midterm, a 10-12 page paper, and a final.  Her exam format was almost identical to 130, and knowing the material from 130 was moderately helpful background knowledge before CM101A.  I love writing papers, so I enjoyed that assignment.

The class's learning curve, however, is steep but brief; once you find your grounding in the background (who the important deities are, why they matter, important symbology), things tend to adhere to common themes throughout the course, and Prof. Waraksa and her TAs do a good job of making sure those themes are pointed out. I recommend the class to anyone who thinks they might be interested in the material, or just wants a change of pace; I certainly came away feeling like I learned way more than I expected to and that the effort was rewarding. It was also more work than I expected, though, so don't think it will be a snoozer GE – you will need to study your terms and the connections between them.","POS: 0.795, NEU: 0.186, NEG: 0.020"

I honestly felt that she wasn't that helpful during office hours or Q&A sessions, but considering these essays are basically our midterm and final, I can somewhat understand why she might not be too keen on handing out answers to people. However, her lecture style (which mostly involves talking/getting sidetracked on people's questions while flipping through a handful of slides with scarce information) has not held up well over zoom and imo wasn't very helpful when it came to writing the actual essays. Which means that, in order to find the answers for each essay, you're going to have to be re-reading the textbook thrice over, scanning your minimal lecture ""notes"", and deep-searching Google for more information.  Is this an interesting class? Certainly some parts are fascinating to learn about. But the biggest flaw with this class is that there is too much information and not enough time to learn it all, which made the take-home essays a wonderful, ""on-your-own"" experience for me. Before you take this class, ask yourself: Am I willing to sacrifice my entire sleep schedule  over the course of 4 separate weeks for a GE? If the answer's no, then maybe avoid it and get some sleep. Sidenote: Participation is MANDATORY in this class.

Also, before her exams they would give a study guide and going through that religiously (pun not intended) would set you up for a good grade. She makes class fun, very energetic, and her TA's were extremely knowledgeable in the subject. Sometimes being part of the religion beforehand had its benefits for some exam questions; for example, there was a specific question on the Christianity exam majority didn't get because it was brushed over during class and wasn't on the study guide.

I struggled with the distanced-learning since participation was 20% of our grade, and attendance is mandatory. This was probably the worst part of the class because Professor Bakhos talked really slow and wouldn’t record lectures and I couldn’t stay focused on anything she was saying. The breakout rooms were too crowded for everyone to contribute, and most of the time we didn’t even have a TA guiding the conversation. The syllabus also says if you miss more than two discussion sections, you can’t pass. However, our discussion sections were great, and we had a group chat where everyone elaborated on the topics we were covering.  In Professor Bakhos’ defense, though, a lot of my complaints would be resolved if in-person instruction was available. I don’t want to discourage you from taking the course if you’re interested, but I definitely struggled with the new format. She also had pretty chaotic and disorganized energy and I’m sure the transition was difficult for her. She seemed like she cared, and she had moments where she was really funny. Our exams were take-home, and we had about a week to do them. They had five short answers, and one long essay at the end. I didn’t study or do any of the readings, and I threw something together the night before it was due and still got a B. My TA gave me very specific feedback and this bumped my next exam up to an A.

I think that’s the one thing that I’m proud to have taken from her and undeniably, it was something I was hoping for from the class. I wanted a new way to view religion, and Bonesho delivered. She prepared incredibly organized and engaging lectures - every single lecture. I do wish the lecture slides held less information and were more engaging sometimes. Once she asked us to send in words through our phones. The words created a word cloud that updated in real-time on the slide. I felt that method’s way of creating vulnerability yet retaining anonymity caught and held everyone’s attention. Bonesho also knew my name, but I’d never been to her office hours or introduced myself to her personally. She probably glanced at it when I handed her one of my papers, but she really had a way of creating an environment where we felt seen, mostly because I think she let the whole class debate almost every lecture, implying all of our nuanced opinions carried some value. I’m really glad I took this class before graduating. I don’t remember what I got so I just put “P”/pass in my review. I did turn in some papers late though and remember her late policy being lenient with grade deductions. Also, for the reading...it's pretty long and in depth, but the book's easy to carry. I didn't read it in full, but by skimming between classes and listening closely to her lectures, I did really well on the exams.

Taking notes is a must, since his exams are based off of exactly what he talks about in lecture, and if you take notes and attend every lecture, as well as go to the discussions and take notes there as well, you're almost guaranteed an A. The class is pretty easy (again, subjective because I love history) because it's straightforward: you learn about civilizations in the Levant, their development, cultures and religions, and talk about all these things during discussions. I have to admit, I did fall asleep 2 or 3 times during the lectures, but this was my first quarter at UCLA and I was still getting used to the workload (it wasn't because of the class being boring). As much as I enjoyed the lectures and how the professor presented the material, I had an amazing TA who really helped make the class all the more enjoyable. The discussions were meaningful and helped prepare for the exams, and also delved into specific topics that the professor could only gloss over during the lectures due to how little time there was for everything. The workload was very light: there were readings each week that were pretty interesting but honestly not that important for the exams or the overall topics, and there was a 2-3 page reflection due each week on a specific topic the professor went over during the lecture. They were extremely easy to do, and most of the time I found myself writing 6-8 pages, and being forced to edit it down to 2-3. The exams were easy, and were literally taken straight from the lectures, so it was almost just summarizing your notes from lecture (just make sure to take good notes and you'll have literally zero problems on the exams). To be honest, I came into the class thinking it was an easy A, and I left with a feeling of satisfaction and happiness of picking this class. If you can take this class, I HIGHLY recommend you do, it was one of the best (and easiest) classes I could have taken for my first year at UCLA.

The lecture before the midterm she ended up repeating a previous lecture for about 15 mins before she realized and rather than turn the lecture into a review; she continued to repeat the SAME lecture for a second time. A lot of people failed the midterm and rather than change her lecture habits she sent a scathing email about how we should change our study habits. Final was cumulative. When many students requested a study guide for the final to better prepare, Simpson refused to provide one sending another email about how we should change our study habits to basically memorize everything ever mentioned in lecture.  A class google doc was made to help study for the exam which was basically the lecture notes for the class. NOT HELPFUL.  The TAs while nice were basically useless,  they didn't/couldn't give any clarity regarding Simpson's lectures or exam material and the TAs wasted a majority of sessions ""teaching""  a class predominately made up of junior & senior history majors how to write a history research paper.

The material in this course centers on Jerusalem and the biblical mythology and history surrounding it, so having prior religious education is advantageous. While I did not find the material in this course particularly interesting, Dr. Smoak was a clear lecturer and always willing to stay on Zoom after class and clarify anything that did not make sense. He was also very understanding of the unique pandemic circumstances; he extended the due dates of several papers and assignments, made the midterm and final very straightforward, and even instituted a generous curve once all grades were implemented, which is honestly the only reason I received the grade I got.Now, in terms of workload, this course is ludicrous. On paper, it just looks like a few readings twice a week and one short response as well as two 6-8 page essays, one being a literary analysis. For a 5-unit GE Writing II course, that doesn’t seem too bad, but my TA expected an advanced comprehension of each and every article and chapter and turned every discussion section into 50 minutes of regurgitating facts, which disadvantaged anyone who was reading the stories for the first time. He marked off points without specific justification on reading responses and essays. I’m not sure if he has grasped the concept that highlighting a sentence and saying “not clear” is lazy and insufficient feedback.Anyway, I digress. This quarter was Dr. Smoak vs. the condescending and infuriatingly aloof TAs, and Dr. Smoak won in the end. Do not listen to reviews that say that this class is easy, because it is only easy if you have a very light schedule and are a naturally good writer.

professor name,gender,class name,reviewer name,review grade," The organization of Professor Smoak was kind of difficult to deal with to be honest. He doesn't post the lecture slides online and most of the lecture during class is commentary on the minimal notes put on the slides that he does present, so it was difficult at time trying to figure out what to take notes on and what to ignore. This class is writing-intensive (as it is a Writing II course) including two main papers, weekly reading responses, and an in-class midterm and final.  For the weekly reading responses, they're mostly graded on completion and answering the prompt (I got 10/10 on most of them just writing boring responses). The weekly reading itself is another reason I'd dock the class on being disorganized. I didn't really know how the reading pertained to the class. He assigned weekly reading under the schedule but it wasn't mandatory so no one actually did it.  As for the in-class tests, the midterm was pretty hard and the final was super easy. His midterm had multiple concepts that weren't listed on the study guide (note: he tests on quotes where you need to know specific words to finish sentences/fill-in-the-blank which were pretty hard, so read the passages he puts on the study guide very carefully). I think he realized that the midterm was harder than he had anticipated, so the final was super easy (I got an 88 on the midterm and a 98 on the final, which was much shorter and a lot easier). For the papers that we had to write, this would probably be my biggest gripe with the class. Professor Smoak and the TA's don't really help that much in writing these papers unless you go out of your way to ask them in office hours to elaborate. During section and lecture, they will tell you what they want to see in the essays, but will hardly give any helpful examples to follow. The prompts for the paper are broad and definitely confused me in the writing process because they had so many facets that I had to narrow down into a single thesis/paper.  I eventually went to the TA's office hours to ask for help on this paper and while my writing itself didn't seem that much better/different, I guess it mirrored what HE specifically wanted to see, so I ended up clutching an A.","NEG: 0.725, NEU: 0.269, POS: 0.007"

However, I will give him credit for extending assignment deadlines, curving the class, and making the midterm and final very manageable. To do well in the class, I would recommend that you come in with significant knowledge of biblical stories (especially Genesis and the Gospels) because if you do you won’t waste time scrolling through the Bible when collecting evidence for your essays. Also, do all the readings because your TA may expect you to have read all of them in discussion. That being said, your TA kinda determines your grade in this course, so if you have a bad one, you’re kinda screwed.

I consider myself a generally strong writer and did not have to put in too much effort to score in the B+/A- range; obtaining a higher grade may be more of a challenge, but I'm sure it's doable. Anyone reasonably proficient with the AP English standard of writing will find that they have no issues writing adequate papers. The required reading, Jerusalem: One City, Three Faiths by Karen Armstrong is so engaging of a read that even if you don't take this course, you'd be served well to read it; it's intended for a general audience and consequently is not too dense. I came to the class with limited prior knowledge of the Bible nor any of the other texts, but I did not find this hurt me; Smoak and the TAs understand that not everyone has this background, and consequently focus on explaining the events through a literary lens more than complex genealogies.

This class is definitely easier for students who have prior Biblical knowledge (and I felt very bad for those who didn't).I understand your TA's will be a constant determining factor throughout college, but my TA only offered 15 minute Office Hours, so there was no way for me to go over my papers (or even homework assignments) in depth because he didn't offer more time. This, of course, was very discouraging because your TA is the one grading your papers and when you can't meet with them or understand what they want from you, it makes it extremely hard to know how to improve. I will say, though, that my TA's comments did overall help me on my revised paper even if I couldn't go over it in person.I felt like the grading was fair, but my main issue was not being given the opportunity to see what an A level paper looks like. We would occasionally see snippets of a ""good"" thesis or paragraph, but it was a struggle to write a ""good"" paper when both the TA and Prof never gave you more specific guidance on what ""good"" looks like.On a positive note, the final and midterm were very straightforward and the professor did a great job of giving us clear study guides that related directly to the exams we took. He really tried to adapt to online learning, and I am sure the in-person exams would have been harder than the assignments/exams we took (which was much appreciated). And a neutral note, there is a looooot of homework and assigned reading. I didn't end up reading most of the companion book because for me it was a lower priority than writing the essays and homework, but like any Writing II class there are a LOT of writing assignments. Overall, it is not an easy class and if you want to improve you really need to find someone outside your class instructors who can help give you feedback on your essays. Prof Smoak is a nice professor, but I struggled to understand what my TA expected from my writing- for those who will take the class, try to understand what your TA expects because it will help you earn the grade you want. I wish the instructors had been more open about showing us what an A paper looks like, but the feedback and grading were (in my opinion) fair. I am grateful for the curve he gave us, but the class was harder and less enjoyable than I thought it would be. (To anyone who wants to take it, though, I say go for it! Just be prepared for the workload and the extra effort you have to put in to understand what the instructors want from your writing.

He infuses pictures and anecdotes of his time in Jerusalem. He is also a nice and approachable person and was more willing to answer my questions than my TA. The midterm (10%) and final (10%) are extremely straightforward. As long as you memorize everything on the study guide that is given, you are set.  Unfortunately, this class has more cons than pros. Instead of learning about religion itself, this class focuses on the architecture and space and how it relates to religion. I wanted to learn more about how the three monotheistic religions developed, and less about how the buildings located in Jerusalem relate to religion. In addition, there are so many assigned readings that will take a few hours each week. 70% of your grade is dependent on your TA. That means that having a good relationship with your TA is key in this class. I had a horrible TA, one that was unwilling to help even when I went to office hours and asked additional questions. My TA was also extremely nit-picky about everything in grading.

Because of the inorganization and insipid style of teaching (I do not even think what he did could be said teaching), no one was paying any attention to what he said. But you got to show up because participation of discussion counts. Also, my TA was very irresponsible on grading papers. On our first draft of first paper, he simply gave the comments with less than 20 words and graded in a low score. We all know writing paper is not as easy as someone else thought. I felt all my time and hard work were just wasted if it was graded by a totally irresponsible TA who did not really care about and read your paper then simply put a grade on your paper made no sense.I ended up with a B and I felt ok, because after all the experiences and feelings related to this course I felt B was enough, surely I would and should not expect with an A because of the lack of background knowledge, no slides to study and my horrible TA.By the way, my TA is Tim Hogue, I do not mean to throw shades on him, but I just want to give you guys a hint that you could switch to another discussion as soon as possible if you are in discussion session with him.

Then you just type out whatever he says after that since you might have to use what he says for the two papers you will write. There are some pros and cons to take away from the fact that this is a writing class. PRO: There is only one midterm and a final. I cannot stress enough how EASY they are. Professor Smoak says it himself. He wants students to focus more on writing papers than studying for the exams. Each exam is made up of multiple choice questions. You can study the night before if you want because many of the questions are one-liners with a three-word answer. Very basic. CON: These exams do not make up a whole lot of your grade. Again he wants students to focus on writing. If this class was graded on exams solely, then it would be considered the easiest GE. PRO: He has PPT slides in class that are easy to take note of. Highlights the main themes from the readings. Not everything that appears on the PPT is on the exams but everything on the exams is on the slides. CON: He does not put PPT slides on the course website. However, he does put up Study Guides of terms and dates needed for the exams. PRO: Most information comes from the readings. CON: There are a lot of readings but I suggest you read them (or skim) since they are long and he takes out only one or two points from like a 40-page passage. PRO: The papers may be worth more than half of the overall grade, but don't fret. Yes, each requires research with the second one requiring much more than the first. No, they are not impossible. Simply research and research some more then use your findings and analyze.  CON: I felt this was pretty surprising but the TAs aren't so helpful. Sure they tell you that your paper should reflect and elaborate on your thesis but there really isn't much more from the TAs than that. The fact that this is a writing class makes it seem like the TAs should offer exceptional assistance in your papers but I didn't feel that way. In addition, that Hacker book - the one about writing - barely any mention of it. Overall, it CAN be an easy GE if you feel like writing and analyzing are simple tasks. Exams are meant to be a breeze, a piece of cake, a walk in the park or whatever you want to call it (took 5 minutes to finish the 50 m/c final). Professor Smoak's delight in teaching shows in every class and he just wants the best out of you.","POS: 0.986, NEU: 0.012, NEG: 0.001"

The material itself is interesting to learn and Smoak makes sure to go over any uncertainties. While I did enjoy the class, I was not a fan of how much work this class required. This class had two quizzes, one midterm, one final, one group project, one research paper,  participation, and a visit to LACMA.  All of the exams were pretty straightforward. Professor Smoak would release a study guide that was useful for the exams. The annoying part about the class was the project, paper, and LACMA assignment. The group project is a gamble and your grade will depend on how well you work in a group. My group actually did stuff, so it was easy for me, but difficult for my peers. The LACMA assignment is inconvenient since you have to go all the way to LACMA on your own. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  The paper is pretty short ( 4 to 5 pages), but it requires you to find 6 sources. Also, don't be deceived by the paper's brevity: it's much harder to be succinct!

I’d say it’s rather easy to do if you’re walking in with some context, and are taking this class for your major. But gosh, if you’re taking this as a GE you’re going to walk out with some heavy misperceptions.  As many have said, this professor is not entirely knowledgeable on all she covers and it seems like she only wants to talk about Ancient Egypt, since it’s her field of study.  Everything outside of that felt brief and confusing, and not as all-encompassing as one would hope for “Women in Ancient Power.” A lot of things are over sensationalized and frankly some not-very-academic commentary and interpretations comprise about half of all lectures. If you’re looking for something entertaining, it might be nice. But for me personally, the broad and sensationalized material (with a severe lack of grounding) was not what I had hoped for when taking this class for my major. The papers are very specific and really, the majority of what you learn with be from independent research and from your TA. Your TA will make or break your experience.

professor name,gender,class name,reviewer name,review grade," The problem with this class is that it is mechanized in such a way that forces you to hold a certain view about women in power both in ancient and modern times. The assignments given literally ask you to explain how women are oppressed, offering no insight to the success stories of women over generations. I actually enjoyed learning about Ancient history, but I did not appreciate AT ALL the revolting bias that polluted her lectures.  Aside from this demeaning factor, Kara is a very clear explainer and a very organized teacher. Each assignment has an explicit rubric and I never really felt lost in the class. I took this course online , so I was able to put her lecture videos on 2x speed (she's incredibly slow at talking). In her videos, she often goes over the assigned readings for the week, so I never even touched one of the readings and yet was still able to participate in the discussions, citing the material and everything.  When I took the course, the grade breakdown was essentially 30% participation (just make sure you speak a lot at every group discussion, citing the lecture videos and all that), 20% for assignment 1 (video/podcast), 30% for assignment 2 (group project, online museum exhibit), 5% for assignment 3 (class reflection). The last 15% was the final, in which we just chose 4 discussion questions from the quarter, so I basically finished my final before it was even released.   Honestly, for this course, getting a good grade depends on your TA. The TA essentially drives the whole course experience for you. I had Anatolii Tokmantcev. He's incredibly smart and on top of his stuff, but he's the PICKIEST grader. I had a zoom meeting with him in which I asked him why I lost points on certain assignments, and he was clearly looking for the most nitty gritty things to take points off.

Each week, there are a couple lecture videos posted on CCLE that you have to watch (the average watch time is 1-2.5 hours).  However, I always watched during meals on 2x speed so it really saved me a lot of time. The readings are kind of heavy but you just have to find time to do it before your discussion section. Also, your TA will post discussion questions for the week that you should look over before your discussion section (participation is a big part of your grade). The workload isn't too bad honestly. There are three assignments: video or podcast (20%), digital museum exhibit (30%), and final reflection paper (5%). The video was not too bad - you interview a female and try tie in what you've been talking about in class about Michael Mann's IEMP powers to someone's real life experiences and analyze that in a video. The digital museum exhibit is a lot more work because you have an individual portion and a group portion. The invidual portion is researching about a female ruler in the ancient times and finding three artifacts that represent her. The group portion is that you all have rulers in vaguely the same region and you write an essay about them (regions like Egypt, China, Greece, Mesopotamia, India). I would say to utilize TA office hours before you turn in the big assignments to check them over and make sure you did not miss anything. Also, the one quart meeting with Professor Cooney is pretty entertaining, I would recommend going. I agree with the sentiment of many other students: she does not really listen or understand your question, but rather goes on a rant (kinda), and when you get frustrated that she's not answering your questions, it's like she is like ""don't worry, I know you'd get angry. But that's what I want you to do and that's how you can make change in the world""?? I'm not sure what's going on with her logic but she just blatantly does not understand students' questions so if you do ask her a question, don't take her response to heart. It sounds she's gone through some things in life so she just gives off a bitter vibe of ""nothing phases me anymore"" and ""you women think you're making progress but you're actually not"". It was kind of disheartening to hear honestly. Anyways, you don't have much interaction with her besides watching her lecture videos.

She brings a lot of scientifically unsubstantiated and frankly misogynistic ideas into the course. She'll say ""science shows"" and then fail to provide actual scientific sources. Coming from a research background, it is also genuinely painful to see her misinterpreting the neuroscience studies that she posts.Cooney is also not receptive to feedback—as others have pointed out, she will not listen to people who offer constructive feedback, even if it's worded in the most polite and concessive way possible. Her attitude is a bit bizarre. She always wants to challenge students that ask her questions even if it means deliberately misunderstanding them.The one positive point to the class is that there is no midterm and final anymore, as you may see in earlier reviews, so the readings are even less important. However, the paper is super heavily weighted and there are some weird grading things. Assignments that are worth 10% of your grade are 10 points, 15% of your grade are 15 points, etc. so if you get a 9/10 on one assignment you've lost 1% of your grade.

professor name,gender,class name,reviewer name,review grade,"When taking Prof. Cooney's class, it is important to consider her as a professor and the class itself as two separate aspects. She herself is engaging and entertaining as a lecturer, she speaks very informally and in layman's terms, so you feel like you're having more of a conversation than a boring drawn out textbook narration. However, since her classes are very based on her lectures and speaking coverage, its very inconsistent. She is definitely knowledgeable and the class does try to cover various subregions, but you can definitely tell that her focus and interests are heavy towards some, so I felt like some days of the class were just not necessary. Also, due to some day offs in the general quarter's calendar in addition to some lectures going into the following ones, we were off schedule according to the syllabus and the last civilizations (China/India) were definitely just squeezed in. The main assignment in this class is a research essay or podcast (something they were testing out as an option my quarter) that you have until the end of the quarter to submit, so your personal time was more focused on whatever you chose and likely didn't really think deeply towards the others. It is necessary to pay attention though because the final itself were 2 critical analysis essays of any region, but she gave the possible prompts ahead of time so you can review for yourself.  Overall, a good class that doesnt take a lot of stress if you can time manage yourself and not be too reliant on in-class/TA help. They didn't regulate how TA's prepared you for the essay writing, so others had more feedback and mini due dates while others were kind of just a ask-me-if-you-need-help.

We were graded based on the midterm, section participation/attendance, final research paper (or final podcast), and a final. Your grade really depends on your section TA, I had Nadia Ben-Marzouk, she really helped by going over what professor covered and clearing up any questions.  The sections focus on the lectures and after week 3 they're basically workshops for your 10-12 page final research paper- make sure you choose a topic you're interested in or else it'll just be terrible. In section, you'll be turning in some short prompts or outlines every two or three weeks that will all help you start your final paper weeks in advance rather than wait last minute. For the final, Professor Cooney will share about six essay prompts but will ultimately end up choosing two, so you know what you're final is about and can be prepared on what to mention. The class overall is alright and although she posts her slides online her commentary in class is more useful.

My TA was really strict and picky about each of his assignments, and that affected the grade I got at the end of the quarter. There are also a lot of readings that she posts for the quarter, and there are a lot that aren't helpful. She is a good professor but she gives all the power to the TA's, and she doesn't really check on them or pay attention to how they run their sections.

professor name,gender,class name,reviewer name,review grade," If you're looking for an easy GE this class might not be it simply because of the amount of writing you have to do. Although the material itself isn't hard, there's atleast one thing always due at the end of the week. There are weekly 1 page ""activity journals"" that you have to complete by Friday 11:59 pm, alongside any other assignments, and often you had to have watched the lectures in order to answer the prompt.  Some of the readings are short but most of them are pretty long, usually 20+ pages. I got by without really reading anything, besides skimming for quotes when I needed them for the paper/weekly activities. Watching the pre-recorded lectures and TA videos are required for participation, as well as having two zoom meetings with your TA. Alonside the weekly activity journals is a 3-4 page paper on Michael Mann's book on ""Sources of Power"" (due week 3), which is a topic you pretty much have to deal with the rest of the quarter. A general consensus the class had on Michael Mann's book is that he talks a lot but says nothing, where he goes on long tangents that aren't always entirely related to what the TAs are looking for. You will have to implement Michael Mann's IEMP model into your research paper/podcast. There is a project that can either be done in paper or podcast form. There was very little guidance/detailed instructions on how to do the podcast, and because this class is online/asynchronous, it is hard to get help on it. Thus, I did the paper and I will only give details on that. The final research paper is due at the end of week 10/beginning of finals week depending on your TA. It has four parts to it. The first part is introduced around week 4 in which you have to start an annotated bibliography and begin forming your preliminary thesis/research argument. The annotated bibliography needs 4 primary and 4 secondary sources, each with a summary of what it is, who its written by, how is it useful for your research, etc. This portion was due week 6 at 11:59pm and is 5% of the total grade.  The second part of the final paper is your rough draft, which must be 10-12 pages in length, and must include a bibliography and a ""figures sheet,"" which is pretty much where you put images of primary sources you used, considering many primary sources you will use consist of ancient relics like tombs, stone carvings, etc. This portion is 10% and due week 8 at 11:59pm. Week 8 is also the only week where there was no activity journal due.  The 3rd portion of the final paper is a peer review due week 9 at 11:59pm and is part of the participation grade. The 4th portion is the final/revised draft due around week 10 at 11:59pm and is worth 30%. A recording of you presenting your research is the final assignment, and is worth 5%.  I personally did not read or buy the professor's book. She also includes online access to other required readings, but her book is not one of them. Professor Cooney's lectures are engaging and she is a great presenter. However, there isn't much guidance on how to formulate your research psper, but it helps to base it on how she dissects each ancient society and what it means for a woman's access to power there. She has a total of two live events, and attending them in full gives one extra credit point for each event.  Overall grading breakdown: Participation 20%Reading Journal 20%Assignment #1- Mann Synthesis 10%Assignment #2- Research Paper (45% total)• Part I- Thesis & Annotated Bibliography (5%)• Part II- Rough Draft (10%)• Part III- Peer Review (part of participation)• Part IV- Final Draft (30%)Assignment #3- Final Presentation/Podcast 5% Depending on your TA, the grading can be strict or lenient. I had Aaron Samuels; although he can be a bit curt, I found him to be pretty chill and a lenient grader conpared to other TA's.

professor name,gender,class name,reviewer name,review grade,"I agree with some of the Fall 2021 reviews, as this class was relatively interesting and truly is about what the class entails, women and power in the ancient world. Professor Cooney's lectures were engaging and you can tell how passionate she was about the topic, but besides that, this is mainly a review of the structure of the class since this is what a lot of people want. There is a LARGE AMOUNT of writing to be done in this class because it is a writing II and a GE requirement. The material isn't hard to grasp but the work itself is very tedious sometimes. There are weekly activity journals (with a prompt) that you'd have to look at the readings and lecture to answer + other participation (40%), a 3-4 page Mann synthesis paper (10%), final 10-12 page research paper/podcast script (45%), and a final presentation (5%). It is a lot I will not lie, but it's split into the quarter fairly well, especially since the course is all online-asynchronous(for the in-person discussion I think they had discussion participation instead of writing activity journals). The prompts were very open-ended but it made it sort of hard to formulate some form of ideas and even tell if your ideas are valid... but your TA is the main source of support and also your grade as well. The stressful part was mainly just the final paper because of the page requirement and how much of your grade it determined, but your TA gives you feed back on your rough draft for you to improve your grade. So yes, this course is heavily reliant on your TA. Thus, this class was exhausting I won't lie but I can definitely say I learned a lot from the course... but I would not really go out of my way to take it out of interest simply because of the amount of work that there was to do!","POS: 0.939, NEU: 0.059, NEG: 0.002"

Then, every week a one-page activity Journal was due based on what you learned that week. Super easy. There was only ever one super hard reading but the TA spent a lot of time making sure we understood.

Her lectures were interesting, although she unnecessarily injects her own political views into the discussion. This is a bit hypocritical, for when students asked about whether or not ancient Egyptians were 'black' or darker toned skin, she told us to stop ""obsessing"" about these types of issues and projecting our own ideas of 21st century race relations onto the ancient past. True, but she should also do the same. 	What really disappointed me about Cooney was our after-class discussion. I approached her with questions about  other Egyptologist's, like John Anthony West. She was very closed minded about new findings & research. She even told me to rely on wikipedia rather than on books I mentioned regarding these topics. When I told her wikipedia is unreliable for anything other then hard facts/general reference, due to biased/anonymous editing, she scoffed at me.  I thought professors, esp. those at UCLA, would have better suggestions for research than wikipedia? What we had discussed must have angered her, because over the  weekend, she had added a slide to the following class lecture. I know she added it because it had nothing to do with the day's subject, instead it had a photo regarding a topic I had mentioned to her. Specifically, it was a picture of a book, alongside a picture of a UFO. I could not believe how petty this was! The book doesnt mention anything about aliens, it was about dating the pyramids as older then 2000BCE, and written by a geologist. If she took the time to skim through its contents she would have known this. But instead, she tried to humiliate me in front of the class by associating new research to unrelated alien theories in order to defend her own dogmas. Not ok and very unprofessional.

As for difficulty, I can't comment on her grading expectations since all of that was handled by her TA's (who were awesome and incredibly helpful). Her class format was not easy, however. Grades consisted partialy of a midterm and final, both essay format in which two prompts would be selected for in-class responses. The midterm pool of potential essays was 6 which was subsequently narrowed to 5, and the final pool was 4 narrowed to 3. The list of prompts came out 2 weeks in advance which was generous. The process of researching and memorizing up to 5 essays was tedious, but the test day selection process didn't appear to be entirely random, and I would suggest putting more time into the prompts which cover the most significant points of the course material. On top of these exams we also had a 12 page research paper which could be on virtualy any topic regarding the Middle and Old Kingdom of Egypt. Definitely dedicate a sufficient amount of time to this assignment. Many people in the class put it off until the the weekend before its due date (which was Wednesday of finals week), and I'm sure the necessity of finals study combined with the research paper brought them poor grades. A nice boost comes from 10% of your grade being participation and attendance, so definitely show up to compensate for any exam or paper shortcomings. A tip for sucess in this class is to take advantage of the TA's copious office hours. Check in with them frequently, as they will tell you straight up if your paper is up to snuff.

professor name,gender,class name,reviewer name,review grade," Your experience in this class depends very much on your TA, as they are the ones grading all your work. With the online environment, the lectures were asynchronous, and the discussions were synchronous. However, during the later half of the quarter, Professor Shayegan decided to make the class synchronous after he realized ""he missed giving live lectures,"" but lectures were still recorded and posted on CCLE. The professor is a very nice person, and he explains very clearly in all his lectures. However, they were a bit bland, as he was reading off the slides most of the time, but that was really helpful oddly enough since there was so much material. Also, he provided lecture notes every week which were also really helpful. Although they weren't as in depth as his lecture slides, they were a consolidation of all the main points from his lectures each week. I had never taken a history course at UCLA before this, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I took this class as a GE, but I was also interested in the topic. The workload is definitely pretty heavy since there's a lot of readings necessary for this class. However, this class is by no means difficult. It's definitely possible to do well even without completely remembering everything from the readings. One thing that may be slightly difficult from the reading is understanding primary sources and analyzing them.  I had never analyzed a translated historical primary source before so it was definitely an adjustment in the beginning.  Here's the grading distribution30% Participation and Attendance in discussion30% Final Paper20% Midterm Paper20% Primary Source Analysis Paper None of the assignments were insanely difficult although writing papers can be time consuming depending on your familiarity with writing historical analysis papers. All the assignments in this class are writing assignments. The primary source analysis paper was open book, and we were given weeks to write it (only 1000-1500 words). The midterm and final were take-home tests, meaning we were given the whole weekend + Monday to complete it. However, the professor and the TA would release the question bank a week in advance so we could prepare ahead of time. Out of the question bank, the professor would choose a few prompts that we'd have to address on the midterm/final. Although there was no word limit, it's recommended each answer to each prompt  be around 500-750 words. One con is that the midterm and final were closed-book so there's quite a few things to memorize before each test. Overall, I quite enjoyed this class. Of course, I'd only recommend you take this class if you have some interest in history or at least the topic of this class. I would take this class again with Professor Shayegan and even other classes he'd be teaching.

It's 1 midterm (35%), 1 final (50%), and attendance (15% ?) . I may be off by 5% or so for these grade breakdowns, but that's roughly what it is. The format is the same for the whole history series, everything I'm about to say will pretty much apply for 110C (and 110B according to my friends). The main thing you have to take seriously is attendance. I am paraphrasing, but Shayegan told us ""I don't care if you sleep, but you have to come."" You sign in for attendance in the beginning portion of class (within 10-15 minutes or so). Apparently students were caught signing in for each other, and I'm not sure how. You're allowed one unexcused absence. It's unclear how further absences will affect your grade but they make it clear that it will. It feels like attendance matters more than they say on the syllabus, based on anecdotes from other people saying they got higher overall grades than they expected. Shayegan will learn your name and he will call you out if he sees you talking/creating a ruckus. We had a big lecture hall and the man still saw and heard everything like an owl. The midterm and the final are both a combination of 1. short answers, which can range from identifying terms, to providing dates, to answering brief questions (i.e. reasons why x battle was won), and 2. multi-paragraph essays (I can't remember if it was 1 or 2 essays). There is a study guide for each one that tells you everything that might appear on the exam. I highly recommend making a classroom document for those. He tells you which questions require the dates.

There are readings, but you really don't need to do them. Just refer to the lecture notes and the slides, which he conveniently provides online. Paying attention in class will help, he'll mention when something's important for the exams. The only time I lifted a finger for this class was right before the midterm and right before the final.
