Molly Fox,NA,Selected Topics in Biological Anthropology: Evolutionary Medicine,ANTHRO 129,A+," Loved this class!!! The lectures were  amazing!! There was definitely a lot of material being covered in each lecture, so note-taking wise there was a lot to write down! Here is a breakdown of the class: 10 Weekly Quizzes: 5 points each Read the Syllabus: 1 point Intro Video: 3 points Genetics Interview Project: 20 pointsReproduction Interview Project: 20 pointsFinal Paper: 20 pointsTotal: 114 points  The Interview Projects I found to be fun and honestly I learned so much about the people I chose to interview. Don't worry they weren't super crazy time consuming, they basically were you talking about the important points of your interview and you tying those points to the lecture material. The final paper was based on a topic of your choice! Overall, the weekly quizzes were super easy and you didn't really need to do the readings! Definitely recommend this class!"
Molly Fox,NA,Selected Topics in Biological Anthropology: Evolutionary Medicine,ANTHRO 129,A,"This is a FANTASTIC class. I have never felt more engaged and excited to learn without the pressures of having to memorize everything and write every single word down. This is the first class I have ever taken and appreciated for the joy of learning itself. Dr. Fox is so wonderful, and this is definitely my favorite class of my college career so far."
Molly Fox,NA,Selected Topics in Biological Anthropology: Evolutionary Medicine,ANTHRO 129,A+,I think Dr. Fox is a fantastic professor! Her lectures were extremely engaging and Anthro 129 was one of the most interesting classes I took at UCLA. She discusses topics in a very in-depth and interdisciplinary way and I think anyone who has an interest in medicine would get something from this class. She clearly cares a lot about the students in her class and was readily available in office hours. I even told her about a performance I was involved in at UCLA and she attended with her husband.
Katja Elisabet Antoine,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,A,"This is the sort of professor and class that makes me excited to be going to UCLA. The material was engaging, the lectures were thought provoking, and the professor was top-notch."
Katja Elisabet Antoine,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,A,"Took this as Race and Gender in Comedy, which was a fantastic introduction to race and gender studies. We had about 2-4 articles of reading per week, all uploaded on CCLE. Never had to buy any materials for this class, and Professor Antoine is very considerate and accommodating  to everyone's needs. I loved how the Professor fostered a safe and open environment for discussion of sensitive topics which are relevant to everyone, both through class discussion and weekly reflections. We had one midterm exam and a final paper, which weren't too hard if you kept up with readings and lectures. I really loved this class and recommended it and the readings from it to multiple people when I was taking it, and will continue to do so going forward. 10/10 would take again"
Hannah Appel,NA,Globalization: Contemporary Issues,GLBL ST 100B,A+,"Professor Appel is by far the most amazing professor I have ever had. I took her IDS 1 class last quarter and learned so much, definitely use her office hours and ask questions. She's very clear and really politically active. I have nothing but good things to say about her! The midterm was an in class written essay (4 question I believe) and the final was a group project. She's AMAZINGG....it was like watching a TEDTalk every lecture"
Hannah Appel,NA,Globalization: Contemporary Issues,GLBL ST 100B,A,"(Upon taking it, it's been renamed to Global Studies 104) Quite frankly I'm finishing up my 2nd year here and have never written one of these reviews but Prof. Appel deserves it. We started this quarter in the middle of a pandemic. Prof Appel was very accommodating (you'd be surprised how many professors weren't) and ensured that if we were consistently not turning in work her or a TA would reach out, concerned about our well-being. Content-wise, this has been my favorite class so far. She's taught me to look at culture in so many different ways with varying implications of each which I was surprised and elated at considering how much overlap there is in other GS courses. I even listened to a few lectures with my mom (who is an accountant and not at all a humanities/social science type person) who liked both what she had to say and how she said it. Starting this class during a pandemic and ending in a time of civil unrest has been interesting and of course, like always, this class was accommodating to the students and didn't prioritize grades over the lives of millions of Americans currently at stake. Even in her emails Prof. Appel provided resources for students that wanted to help the movement and was apart of the coalition of teachers that demanded that UCLA answer to why their facilities were used by LAPD to detain their own students. I'm not sure how this class looks in a completely different world setting but I can assure you that Prof. Appel is awesome."
B.A. Hauser,NA,Selected Topics in Biological Anthropology,ANTHRO 129,A,"So this review is actually for Anthro 1 - Human Evolution, which I took with Prof. Brooke Hauser (she also goes by Brooke Scelza). It was a great class, the professor is very fair on grading and the subject matter is very interesting. Her research, which she did with the Himba people of southern Africa, was also super cool, especially how she integrates concepts, photos, and stories from her research into the course.  I'll be taking another class with her next quarter and I'm looking forward to it!"
Jason De León,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,A," Hands down the best professor I've had at UCLA. Professor De Leon's lectures are always very engaging! In addition, he is extremely understanding and considerate of students. He did not have us purchase any additional class material/books. He is passionate about what he does, which makes his lectures even more fun. I highly recommend taking ANTHRO 139 with Professor De Leon.   P.S. He even brought a legend to play for us and speak with us. (Guest Lectures)"
Jason De León,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,A+,"This class was easy, but I still learned a lot. He starts every lecture with music, and has guest speakers. He doesn't make you purchase a book. Jason de Leon is literally the  chillest professor ever."
Wendy Giddens Teeter,NA,Introduction to American Indian Studies,AM IND M10,A+," Note: I believe Professor Teeter is moving on to do some work with indigenous tribes so this is more of a review of AmIndM10 in general. You should take this class if you want an easy GE. Firstly the grading is very lenient: it’s based on 5 discussion posts (full marks for engaging i.e a paragraph or two), discussion attendance (both being present and contributing), and 5 essays (750-1000 words each). The essays were quite easy to score well on because only 5/20 pts were based on content, the other 15 was things like citing enough sources and meeting the word count.  The workload depends on you. The readings are often very long, but not all readings need to be read for the purpose of the essays/discussion post so you can actually skim/skip a lot without having it negatively affect your grade. The 5 essays are usually once every fortnight and are 750-1000 words so relatively light. Overall the course is fairly easy but also what you learn is definitely very enlightening."
Wendy Giddens Teeter,NA,Introduction to American Indian Studies,AM IND M10,A+,"I took this class to fulfill a GE requirement, and it was my favorite GE by far. Professor Teeter was extremely clear during lecture and the workload was extremely manageable. We had 5 short writing assignments as opposed to longer papers or tests, and the prompts really helped to make connections between the course's different topics. Marina was also an amazing TA and extremely accommodating!"
Wendy Giddens Teeter,NA,Introduction to American Indian Studies,AM IND M10,A+,"Really enjoyed this class a lot! I actually took it for my global health minor and didn't think I would enjoy it as much as I did since it's outside of my major/minor focus more generally. Class structure involved lectures once per week, weekly readings, and then alternate assignments of reading logs and essays. Reading logs were really easy as we just had to reflect on a couple of the readings for completion credit, but essays did involve a bit more work (as we had to incorporate outside sources), but at least in my opinion were not graded harshly at all. Overall, I felt like the grading was very fair and never once stressed about my grade in the class as long as I kept up with assignments (1 week grace period helped as well) and often could get away with skimming the readings for key themes/ideas (since I didn't have time to read every word). Beyond the grades though, the subject matter of the class was something I never really learned that much about in high school touching on things like: genocide/displacement, boarding schools, indigenous activism, cultural appropriation/use of the ""Indian Mascot"", and indigenous futurism. I found all the topics, lectures, course discussions etc. to be extremely interesting and valuable for anyone who wants to be mindful of the foundations of the society we live in. Note, I had Elizabeth as a TA and she was amazing as well in terms of leading interesting class discussions every week. This class was one of my favorites at UCLA (I'm a senior) and I would highly recommend it if you have the chance to take it for your major, minor, GE, or just for fun/to learn. Dr. Teeter is great and makes the class accessible to all!"
Shannon Speed,NA,Special Topics in Gender Studies,GENDER 185,A+,"There is a bit of writing in this class. However, it is all doable. The material is fantastic and engaging."
Rebecca Steinberg,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A-," Easy Anthropology class. My TA was Ricardo. If he's still there, sign up for his section or switch over! He is so helpful and that's coming from the shystudent. He treats everyone fairly. Professor Steinberg is so clear and loves her research. Great class. Learned a lot. Selling textbook:Making Sense of Language: Readings in Culture and CommunicationSecond Editionby Susan D. Blum I will ship it to you priority for only $25 total. I accept Venmo. I will ship ASAP and include a tracking number for you :) Text me: (424) 204-2951"
Christopher Stephan,NA,Visual Anthropology: Documentary Photography,ANTHRO 135,A+,Stephan is one of the best professors I have taken at UCLA. I took him during covid and he was extremely supportive and understanding. He is also a great lecturer and makes it easy to understand. The assignments were easy as he provided detailed information on what he expected and what to include (they were also really fun). 10/10 recommended taking him!!!
Amy Malek,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,B+,Professor was very clear during lectures. Likes to talk about her research as it pertains to the class which is great!.  Attendance is mandatory if you want to be successful in this class.  Office hours are flexible and you should attend at least twice during the quarter.
Lana Martin,NA,Principles of Archaeology,ANTHRO 110,A+,"This class is one of the best I have ever taken at UCLA. Lana genuinely cares about her students and loves teaching, it shows through the way the material is presented. the class is set up with continuous work to make sure you are keeping up. For the summer course, there were 4 writing assignments where the best 3 were taken for your grade. there were 5 online labs which were fun and engaging. then the midterm and final were both take home.  This course is engaging and fun."
Eva Melstrom,NA,Community and Corporate Internships in Anthropology,ANTHRO 195CE,A,"I had Eva as my TA for Global Health 100, I'm leaving this review here because I know she's about to be a professor and people will want to see what she's like. I've almost never had a TA who cared so much about her students. Eva is super super engaging, genuine, and understanding. She always advocated for us to make sure the professor's assignments were reasonable. She also made such an effort to keep us interested in the class even during Zoom University.  Her work is fascinating, and she always had interesting and nuanced thoughts on the broad range of topics we discussed in the course. Even when we had questions about something specific and different from the core themes on the class, she was educated on it and had helpful opinions to share. She goes the extra mile to make sure we learn and I'm sure she will be an excellent professor with generous grading."
Derek Milne,NA,Anthropology of Religion,ANTHRO 142P,B+,"Dr. Milne is one of the finest lecturers at UCLA.  Though he can be very rigorous, he is always there to help.  He is very laid back and friendly.  He even brought his dog, Keiko, to almost every class meeting.  He is both an outstanding teacher and a great academic.  It's rare to find these kinds of professors at UCLA.  Take him if you are wondering what class to take for summer session C."
Jorge Lazareff,NA,Selected Topics in Biological Anthropology,ANTHRO 129,A+,"Dr. Lazarreff is one of the best professors at UCLA. Take this class if you need an easy A. Note-taking and attendance are not required. The only thing we had due the entire quarter was our final which consists of 5 short answer true/false questions that DO NOT relate to the lectures. He is more so testing you on common sense and how well you can argue your answer. Example question: ""True or false. Science is the accumulation of knowledge."" Wish I could take him every quarter! It's a shame he teaches just the one class in Winter."
Jorge Lazareff,NA,Selected Topics in Biological Anthropology,ANTHRO 129,A+," Dr. Lazareff was an incredible professor. Due to COVID, he just had pre-recorded lectures and posted them on CCLE along with his slides. He gives the questions to the exams about 15 days in advance and all of the answers are in the slides and presentations so there's really no reason as to why you can't get an A+ in the class. He values the argument of your answer more, so even if you answer a T/F question wrong but you have a solid argument, then you'll still get full credit. It's just him teaching the course; he has no TAs or any other faculty helping him so he's always available via email and a Zoom call by appointment if needed. The final was the exact same way where he uploaded a PDF of the questions 10 or so days in advance, and you just need to find the answers and explanation and submit them before the deadline.  The professor himself was amazing and taught everything that was tested; there were no surprises. I plan on meeting up with him after COVID and having a cup of coffee with him or something; he's so genuine and a very interesting guy!! I recommend taking his course about neurosciences for the social sciences."
Jorge Lazareff,NA,Selected Topics in Biological Anthropology,ANTHRO 129,A+," If you need an easy A, take this class.  Dr. Lazareff is very kind and extremely knowledgable, however, he can come off a bit rude sometimes and will call anyone out (ruthlessly) for talking or being on their phone and asks you to repeat your conversation to the class. Aside from this, he is very passionate about neuroscience and is a very smart guy.  As far as the class goes, I never thought I'd say this, but it was too easy! As someone who loves neuroscience, I was very interested in learning a lot of valuable information, and although I did that, I wanted ways to challenge that information and fortify it. There is no homework, no textbook, no projects, no quizzes, and only one final exam. You have weekly quizzes (although we only took 4) and they only count for participation. Then at the end of the quarter, everyone starts off at a 90%. If you get 1 or 2 wrong on the final, you get an A+. 3 or 4 wrong is an A, etc.  Overall, I liked the class I lot. I learned a lot but I definitely wanted something to challenge me a little more. Because I knew there was no assignments or tests, it made me lazy. I would recommend if you need the A and like neuroscience, but the structure of the class needs some adjustments."
Jemima Pierre,NA,Introduction to Black Studies,AF AMER 1,N/A,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOUR TA IS NATALINA MONTEIRO!!! I read all of the reviews and thought this class would be an easy A in the summer with relatively interesting content but I was utterly fucked over by my TA. In the async format, the grading is split into 30% discussion board posts, 35% midterm, 35% final. The midterm is a take-home exam composed of short responses and two essays based on content from Weeks 1-3. It's a lot of writing and kinda time-consuming but mostly follows the content from the lectures. The final (I didn't take it because I dropped) is a similar format of being a take-home exam with essay questions on Weeks 4-6. Every week, you have to watch lectures, films, and do readings and write two discussion board posts and two replies. There are three ""lessons"" each week, each with its own set of readings and/or films as well as 1-2 30-60 min lecture videos. The discussion board questions align very closely to the lecture topics and aren't too difficult. This class would have been easy and stress-free but my TA graded unnecessarily harshly, giving out 2/3s and 2.5/3s on the discussion posts because she didn't think you ""proved you read the material"" even if you had. The only directions for the posts were that they had to be more than 5 sentences but her expectations were upwards of 400-500 words per post with time stamps and citations, even when the directions did not specify that. The 2s and 2.5s added up and made it basically impossible for me to get an A in the course before my midterm was even graded, which is why I dropped. She didn't grade anything until the end of Week 5 out of 6 so I couldn't even drop for a refund. She also never responded to my email asking about why she took off random points for my discussion posts. The class content is actually really interesting so it's a shame I had to drop because of a shitty TA :/ I'm sure the class is an easy A and well worth your time if you get another TA though"
Jemima Pierre,NA,Introduction to Black Studies,AF AMER 1,A+,"This class is the easiest of Ws. You learn quite a lot of important concepts as well; I would even suggest that this class be mandatory for students here, since it is so crucial to understanding American social struggles, and everyone can take away something important from this course. Highly recommend this course for anyone who wants an easy GE, while also wanting to learn a bit too. 10/10"
Jemima Pierre,NA,Introduction to Black Studies,AF AMER 1,A," This class is so great! You learn about very important issues and Dr. Pierre is a great lecturer. The books we read for this class are very interesting, and the readings and lectures are too. Dr. Pierre brings in amazing guest lecturers and I really like that. You can tell she's very smart and passionate and that's great to be around (it was an online class, but I still like her energy).  There are not that many assignments week-to-week, but I say the midterm and final exam are time consuming.  I had Joelle Julien as my T.A. and she was great too! Overall, great class, great professor, and I would take it again."
Jemima Pierre,NA,Introduction to Black Studies,AF AMER 1,A,"Amazing class, if you need to knock off a GE this is a go-to.  The class is at your pace and all assignments are easy as long as you pay attention to the lectures. You will have a blast while educating yourself on important issues!!"
Jemima Pierre,NA,Introduction to Black Studies,AF AMER 1,A+,i really enjoyed this class and professor! appreciated that she offered it online because it worked super well with my schedule but I still feel like i got a ton out of it!! learned a lot more than anticipated.
Jemima Pierre,NA,Introduction to Black Studies,AF AMER 1,A+,Prof Pierre gives amazing lectures and her TA was pretty decent. The only A+ I've gotten at UCLA
Jemima Pierre,NA,Introduction to Black Studies,AF AMER 1,A," Quick Summary if you do not want to read the following: not an easy class, but you can learn a lot indeed. Looking at the past gradings of this class, one might assume that this is an easy class and want to take it to fulfill the GE requirement. Please do not assume that if you are taking it in summer. The workload was enormous. Basically, every week you have video lectures, some documentaries, lots of readings, and there are two novels to be finished along with the progress of this class. Weekly assignments are the discussion posts. You would easily procrastinate because you are not necessarily pushed to do all the reading and watch all the documentaries, but then here comes the midterm and final. I wrote 10 pages for the midterm and 20 pages for the final.  Nevertheless, this is a very very insightful class if you really pay attention to all the details mentioned. The recordings included not only Dr. Pierre's lectures, but also interviews with scholars, and lectures given by scholars in the specific fields. You acquire not only historical facts, but also different perspectives and approaches to understand and analyze the ""black experience"" (not only in the United States, but actually across the world)."
Jemima Pierre,NA,Introduction to Black Studies,AF AMER 1,A+,"This class was extremely interesting. However, the workload was very intense. There were immense amounts of reading and writing that we had to do. Additionally, when the TA strike happened, we continued to have to do all of that work, but received no grades until over a month after the quarter ended. I had Professor Edu, not Professor Pierre, and this was an unusual circumstance, but it was very frustrating. The class itself is amazing and informative though, so I recommend with a different professor!"
Jemima Pierre,NA,Introduction to Black Studies,AF AMER 1,F,The content taught in this class is absolutely amazing. The workload is also easy to handle as you just have to watch lectures and post in two discussions a week. There is just the final and midterm which both consist of multiple easy writing prompts. Altogether this class is great. The problem comes with the professor NEVER responding to emails and never being very clear with the specifics of how she wants her papers. Also the TAs graded absolutely nothing the entire quarter so you never know how to improve because they continue to give more and more assignments without grading. Honestly it's a good class just annoying how you never know what your actual current grade is.
Jemima Pierre,NA,Introduction to Black Studies,AF AMER 1,A+,"This was the perfect class all-around. You have to submit a discussion post every week and the grading is very fair with that. The exams follow really closely with the class materials. We were given about a week to do them so you could split them up which made it stress-free. Lectures are pretty short and are very well-done. The class teaches you very important lessons about African American history and the challenges they face in society today. My TA, Mauri, was very fair with grading and had a lot of passion for the subject.  So, I highly recommend her."
Jemima Pierre,NA,Introduction to Black Studies,AF AMER 1,A,"This is a great class that teaches valuable material! The grading consists of a midterm, final, discussion posts, and a one page mini essay. The mini essay is great as the prof gives you 3 opportunities throughout the quarter to submit the mini essay, so if you have a lighter week 3 you can get the assignment out of the way early, or you can wait til week 9 to submit. While tedious, the readings are interesting and informative. There are 2 discussion posts you have to answer every week with a brief 4-5 sentence response. Then you must respond to 2 discussion posts in 3-4 sentences, so not a huge time investment. The midterm and the final are short answer and essay based, but if you did the discussion posts you’ll be set. The lectures are filmed and edited by the UCLA film dept, so lectures seem more like mini documentaries. And they are SHORT. Most were under 30 minutes. If you are good at managing time then this asynchronous class is for you. Sucks to not have more communication with the prof and TA tho. Wish it hadn’t taken til week 10 to get my midterm back from week 5"
Jemima Pierre,NA,Introduction to Black Studies,AF AMER 1,A,"I adored this class. Prof Pierre is an interesting lecturer and the actual material taught in the class I found super intriguing. There is a fair amount of reading but you don't really have to read all of it. Is is helpful however to read the two required books, which were overall both good reads. I would absolutely recommend this class as an easy GE, as well as if you are interested in this area of study."
Jemima Pierre,NA,Introduction to Black Studies,AF AMER 1,A,I took this class asynchronously even the discussion were asynch. It was a great class though. The prerecorded lectures were precise and informative. Quite a bit of writing for the class and discussion section. But def doable.
Jemima Pierre,NA,Introduction to Black Studies,AF AMER 1,A+,"I learned so much more than I was expecting to about the history of the United States through this class, and believe that this class should be required for every college student! The professor Dr. Pierre was incredibly kind as well, considering the hardships a lot of students have faced during the pandemic. The workload is manageable and the class was asynchronous! Definitely would recommend this as a GE to fulfill one of your requirements!"
Jemima Pierre,NA,Introduction to Black Studies,AF AMER 1,A+,"I never had the chance to interact with Dr. Pierre personally as all lectures were prerecorded BUT this class was AMAZING. It was very easy yet also very engaging. There was a variety of lecturers who all offered unique and personal perspectives on a variety of topics. The material was all super interesting and very eye-opening as well. I saw another review that suggested this class be required for all students and if that was ever possible I would agree 100%.Overall: easy, interesting, and very manageable workload. Best possible GE you could take IMO."
Jemima Pierre,NA,Introduction to Black Studies,AF AMER 1,A," This class is an easy GE, but it is a little tedious in regards to the readings/ lectures we had every week. It was interesting in the beginning, but I felt so disconnected halfway through the quarter because it felt as if I was watching/ reading the material simply to get it done and I did not gain much from it. This class is essentially self-paced, so I eventually stopped reading the material and only really watched the lectures. I only read the material when required for the discussion forums that we had + midterms/ finals. Your grade is made up of weekly discussion forums, one paper, midterms, and finals. Your midterms and finals are simply short answer + long answer questions to the material that you should have read/ watched within the previous weeks. So pretty easy! The only complaint I have about this class is that it is literally impossible to reach the TAs + professor of this class. I am 99% sure that they read our emails but choose not to reply to them which is honestly so unprofessional of them. So good luck with that! Your best bet in getting your questions answered is asking your peers in the class. Be sure to join the GroupMe or create one if there isn’t one already!"
Jemima Pierre,NA,Introduction to Black Studies,AF AMER 1,A+,"This class has been one of the most interesting classes I've taken at UCLA. This was my first Black Studies class and just when you think you are educated on topics like racism and Black History, this class shows how we don't really know much about African American studies, but the surface of it. For this class, you do have to read articles, but I didn't mind reading them because they were so intriguing. My TA was awesome as well and you can tell that everyone is so passionate on this topic and I have never seen a more passionate professor than Pierre and the other professors that helped her teach this topic. I would take this class again, it isn't much work. You watch the lectures, you have two discussion posts each week and one discussion post in the week of your midterm and final. If you watch the lectures and do the reading and take detailed notes, you are good to go for the midterm and final. Got a perfect score on my discussion post, midterm, and final!"
Jemima Pierre,NA,Introduction to Black Studies,AF AMER 1,A,"This class is pretty interesting and informative and you get to learn a lot about black studies. If you take it during summer there are three lectures per week with readings accompanied and sometimes there are also screenings to watch, which can be a lot of work so it's very important to stay on track. The grading consists of 30% discussion board questions, 35% midterm and 35% final.  Midterm and final are short answer and long essay questions, both open book.  The lectures are done by multiple professors so it's really nice to get different perspectives. I definitely recommend this class for everyone!"
Jemima Pierre,NA,Introduction to Black Studies,AF AMER 1,A+,"This class was online and super easy GE. Just had weekly discussion posts and then an open note midterm and final that was based on the lectures that were posted. Also had to write an essay for a novel, but not a ton of work and interesting information"
Jemima Pierre,NA,Study of Social Systems,ANTHRO 140,A,"Professor Pierre is no doubt an extremely knowledgeable and helpful professor who loves what she does and has much to offer. She is kind, accepting, and accommodating in every way. The workload is fairly reasonable with weekly readings (student purchased) followed by weekly reflection papers and three exams. With that being said, the structure of this class did not work well with me. This class should be considered two separate classes with how it is broken up and structured. There is lecture and discussion that both seem to encompass two completely different concepts, ideas, and set of materials. In discussion, students are expected to read multiple books and write weekly reflections on them. These discussions, which are heavily student driven, consist of students talking about the key points and ideas of the books. Conversely, when attending lecture, often the readings are not even discussed, brought up, or relevant to the lecture itself. These lectures also consist of Professor Pierre almost entirely reading slideshows verbatim. Personally, I feel attending lecture is useless when a professor takes an hour and a half to read a slideshow that is available online that I could read in 15 minutes on my own. Furthermore, she talks extremely fast and often stumbles over her words making it sometimes difficult to follow what she is saying or where she is going with her thoughts. Again though, this is counterbalanced by a very heavy reliance on slideshows but is also bolstered by her frequent asking of student questions with further explanations if necessary. Overall, Professor Pierre is a wonderful professor who no doubt has a passion for what she does, but personally, the style of her teaching doesn't work well with me."
Jemima Pierre,NA,Study of Social Systems,ANTHRO 140,A+,"I really liked this class and learned so much from it. We were assigned to read three ethnographies through the quarter, and each was very interesting. Also, we were assigned to watch movies that were eye-opening and fabulous. Being an IDS major, I really took away important ideas that will help me with this major. You won't regret taking this course because when you finish it, you realize how much you have learned in just 10 weeks. Grading is as follows:Attendance+participation+response papers=20 pointsExam 1=25 pointsExam 2=25 pointsExam 3=30 pointsThe exams are not cumulative. You read a book in three weeks, attend the lectures, watch a movie and take the exam. Most answers come from the lectures (the professor posts lecture notes for the students) and the rest is from the movie and the book. Her exam questions never confused anyone as they were very clear and easy.Professor Pierre is very knowledgeable and passionate about the topic. I also had an amazing TA, Sita, who is very smart and helpful! Take this class! You will love it! Good luck!"
Jemima Pierre,NA,Study of Social Systems,ANTHRO 140,A,"Very knowledgeable professor. Took the class during covid-19 pandemic. She doesn't record any of the lectures or discussions, so that was kinda hard because I had a 15 hour time difference (I was waking up at dawn trying to listen to her speak), but she gives very detailed lecture notes that were very useful for the exams. Her exams are open book, and in the form of short answers and essays, and she gives you a week to do them. Super accommodating on that part. We have to finish 3 books throughout the quarter, so each week we had about 2-3 chapters to read, and a reading response to submit. But the responses make sure that you're reading, and they really help for the exam. Overall a great class. I definitely recommend you take this class."
Jemima Pierre,NA,Study of Social Systems,ANTHRO 140,A,"difficult class in that the readings were super dense. the class was structured around three ethnographic novels that were difficult to understand, very dense, like graduate level stuff tbh (this was my perspective as a non-anthro major). but you can get by if you understand the basic concepts from section and ask questions. the lectures are AMAZING though, professor Pierre takes a very liberal stance when it comes to capitalism and I loved learning from her. I learned so much about US imperialism, indigenous struggles against settler colonialism, and neoliberalism in the West African context."
Fernanda Neubauer,NA,Archaeology of North America,ANTHRO 113P,N/A,"Dr. Neubauer is my favorite professor at UCLA after taking this class. She is so knowledgeable and cares a lot about the subject and her students. The course was divided into two quizzes, a short paper and a research paper+debate. All the assignments are manageable as long as you come to lecture and complete the readings (which are usually quite interesting). She offers a lot of extra credit that can boost your grade up to two ranges (B+ to A). She also notes that if you participate in class and care about your grade, she might even boost it to three ranges! Take this class you won't be disappointed, as long you somewhat have an interest for archaeology."
Fernanda Neubauer,NA,Archaeology of North America,ANTHRO 113P,A+," Excellent class. Very easy A,  very good lecturer. The first multiple choice was out of 27 but she said anyone who got 25 got 100%. The papers are easy the only difficulty is they are so short and you have to reference 3+ sources on 1 page double spaced. She says they are this short because she is the only grader. She would benefit from a TA as students cannot really make an argument in such a short paper. There is a lot of reading, 2-4 papers a week ranging from 4 pages to 100 so just be wary. Each paper has a McQ question in the quiz and some are simple like ‘what is their main argument’ and others are far harder like ‘which group did the author study to investigate the trend’. You can skim them but it’s best to take notes. Only 1 class I’m the quarter requires participation. The class has a very good atmosphere mainly because the lecturer is so nice. She is funny and clear her slides are excellent. I learnt a lot."
Fernanda Neubauer,NA,Archaeology of North America,ANTHRO 113P,A,"Professor Neubaeur was great! I honestly was hesitant when I enrolled in her class because she had no reviews and she is new to UCLA, but this class was amazing! Very very easy to get an A, there are also two short extra credit papers you can do to bump your grade but I didn't even need them. There are two quizzes and two papers, with one of the papers being 45% of your grade along with 5% of a debate participation based on that paper. She grades superrr leniently and is very fair. The quizzes were open note and based on the readings and powerpoint lectures she had. As long as you do all the assignments you won't get less than an A."
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,History of Asian Americans,ASIA AM 10,A,"This is my first time writing a Bruinwalk review and it's because I LOVE PROFESSOR FONG. She is the best professor I've had at UCLA thus far, and I've been here for three years now. She took such care to convert her class to an online format that was organized and well thought out so that students were never confused about their responsibilities or expectations for the course. Though the class was online, she was able to connect with her students and provided a space for us to connect with each other. She has such a mastery of the subject matter she teaches, and explains extremely complex issues with incredible clarity. Beyond that, she did extra work to connect course material to current events that helped me to understand the underlying issues much better than I would have been able to on my own."
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,History of Asian Americans,ASIA AM 10,A-,"I got an A- in this class because I didn't use my office hours to go talk to my TA about my essays. I think that if I did, I would've ended up with an A. This class has a good amount of weekly readings and Professor Fong is a great lecturer, so if you are just on top of your readings and go to class, you will be fine. The midterm and final are both short-answer and long-answer essay tests and are not too difficult."
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,History of Asian Americans,ASIA AM 10,N/A," Dr. Fong is very passionate about the subject and explains course material very well. Some of the stuff in her lectures is just a repeat of what's in the assigned readings, but the repetition makes the info stick. There's a lot of extra credit for this class (20 points possible) so be on the look out for that. Something else that's also very helpful is that she puts out constant reminders for assignment deadlines. Make sure to take notes during lecture because she doesn't let you save her slides and she removes the slides/lecture vids from Canvas a week after she posts it.  Also, I'm selling a brand new copy of The Best We Could Do by Thi Bui for $12! Email me at cakerolle@gmail.com if you're interested."
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,History of Asian Americans,ASIA AM 10,A," I entered this class with little interest in the topic, because I heard it was an easy class. I genuinely feel interested in the topic now due to Dr Fong's enthusiasm for the topic. Lectures are well structured, and readings complement topics covered in lecture very well. There is adequate preparation for exams, and the requirements for the final paper are clearly laid out. Grading in this class is also very lenient"
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,History of Asian Americans,ASIA AM 10,A,"This was one of the most engaging classes I've taken at UCLA. Professor Fong is an amazing lecturer. She transitioned very nicely to online and was able to adjust her class with the student's learning being her top priority. I would highly recommend taking this class if you are Asian American because it gives you major insight into your ethnic group's history with the US, something overlooked in normal history classes. There are a lot of readings but they give needed background for lecture."
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,History of Asian Americans,ASIA AM 10,N/A,"Professor Fong was by far the best, most engaging, and most accommodating professor I've had thus far at UCLA! Despite the transition to online instruction being so sudden, her efforts in making her lectures and slides more accessible to us at home while also involving discussions regarding recent events such as the BLM movement and COVID-19 anti-Asian sentiment. Her lectures were engaging and packed with information, and her class readings were long but very interesting to read as an Asian-American myself. I will definitely look to take more classes taught by her in the future, and I 110% recommend taking Asian Am 10 even if you're not a North campus major."
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,History of Asian Americans,ASIA AM 10,A-," this was my favorite class this quarter! Professor Fong and all the TAs are very approachable, easy to talk to, and you can tell they're genuinely passionate about what they do. especially if you identify with being Asian American, you learn about your own history, and it's very interesting.  most of the homework was just readings, which are easily manageable. i recommending spreading them out over the week so that you're not reading everything last minute. over the quarter, you're working on a thesis paper that requires you to interview an Asian-American. there are deadlines for drafts and bibliographies, which were all very helpful and helped prevent procrastination for the most part. the midterm and final were all short answers and an essay (the final has 2 essays). these were also very manageable as long as you listen in lecture and discussions and study from your notes.  Professor Fong doesn't post the slides, but she goes over the material at a great pace and gives enough time for students to take notes. she doesn't allow people to use phones or take pictures (you WILL get called out if you do), but she does allow laptops.  the only issue i had with the class was that it was an 8am lecture but it be like that. also, since we're on the quarter system, we don't get to cover all the Asian-American history and groups in as much depth as I had hoped.  nonetheless, 10/10 recommend"
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,History of Asian Americans,ASIA AM 10,A,"Dr. Fong gives great lectures. They are organized, informative, and concise. I learned so much about Asian American history. Because she does not post slides, you must take notes. The midterm and final were in-class essays on certain topics we had covered (no surprise here). Though, I did find the grading to not be extremely easy but not extremely difficult either. They were like AP exam formats with short answer prompts and a long essay. I felt so burned out during the final. As for our papers, we did an oral history paper 7-9 pages. That was cool, but I had already done one before so it was not as exciting for me. Definitely go to OH and ask for feedback from Dr. Fong and/or your TA."
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,History of Asian Americans,ASIA AM 10,A,"Professor Fong is amazing and extremely helpful. Her lectures are concise, succinct, clear, and straight to the point. All the information she provides is helpful. The TAs are also very helpful and they will do what they can to promote your success. Asian American studies as a class is also very informative; I learnt a lot about an unspoken and underrepresented history of a growing minority group in the US, and enjoyed learning about the personal aspects of immigration history. The workload is not too much; there is quite a bit of reading but the readings are not difficult to understand and for the most part are interesting. Personally the midterm and final exam were not difficult at all; as long as you attend lecture and do your reading, you should be good to go. There is a term paper but it was not difficult and was open-ended. Overall, highly recommend taking this class! It's fun, not too difficult, and will give you a fresh perspective on American history."
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,History of Asian Americans,ASIA AM 10,A,"Dr. Fong is a fantastic lecturer and the slides are organized very well. The topics covered in class are made very meaningful and I genuinely felt like I learned a lot from this class. The midterm and final consists of 2-3 short answer questions chosen from 4-5 possible questions and a long essay; no multiple choice. I felt they were both graded very fairly. She does not bruincast her lectures, which is a shame, but doing the readings and sharing notes will provide more than enough material to sufficiently write about on the midterm and finals.  Both Dr. Fong and my TA, Reuben, were very passionate about the topic and showed that they cared that we were actually taking something away from taking the class. They were very friendly and approachable and I encourage you to take advantage of office hours. There are also a couple opportunities for a considerable amount of extra credit up to 2% of your grade. The other major components are the research paper, which I actually really enjoyed doing and discussion. Overall, I felt like the class was worthwhile, not too difficult, and I would definitely take another class with Dr. Fong if I can."
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,History of Asian Americans,ASIA AM 10,A,"AAS 10 was an incredible class, especially with Dr. Fong. She is one of the best lecturers I've ever had and is super helpful and accessible. Her lectures are organized and engaging, and she connected some of her own family history and research into the class. The oral history paper wasn't bad and was actually quite fun to write! If you're looking for an interesting introduction into history or ethnic studies, take this class - you won't regret it."
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,History of Asian Americans,ASIA AM 10,A,"This was such an amazing class. Professor Fong was an engaging lecturer, and she really picks topics that are interesting and relatable. As an Asian American, it was very eye-opening to learn about American History from the lens of the many Asian American immigrants who came before me. This was hands down one of my favorite classes I have taken thus far at UCLA, and is honestly not too hard to do well in. Make sure to show up to discussion sections and lecture, as Professor Fong does not post her slides online later. For the midterm and final, doing the given study guide is actually really helpful and of course supplementing it with the notes you take from the slides in lectures. As for the paper, make sure to visit your TA as they are very helpful and will give valuable feedback. Overall, I recommend this course if you are looking for an interesting GE that is not too hard to do well in!"
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,History of Asian Americans,ASIA AM 10,A," I took this class because it fulfilled the diversity requirement, but it has done so much more than that. I genuinely feel like I learned so much about my ethnic background and history, which has made this class personal and engaging. Many students could make connections between the course material and their lives. Teaching style: I appreciate how concise Dr. Fong's slides were.  For the majority of her lectures, she finished PRECISELY on time, like it's crazy how good she is at pacing her lectures even with the unpredictability of students' questions. I also appreciate how she changed her intonations and whatnot, so she wasn't talking in a boring monotone, which helped keep me awake for the 9:30 class (I'm not a morning person). She constantly made explicit connections between her personal life and the course material (i.e. showing pictures of her own grandma participating in a strike) that just really emphasized the personal nature of this course for many students. Workload: A lot of my classmates fell behind in the readings and never bothered catching up, but I did all of the assigned readings and I can say that while most, not all, of the readings were relevant and useful for providing in-depth context for the lectures, but they were generally unnecessary for the exams. The readings included chapters from the required textbook (you'll end up reading practically the entire book by the end of the quarter) along with excerpts posted on CCLE, which took hours to keep up with. The only other homework besides the reading was a final interview and paper in which you have to interview a 40+ year old person of Asian descent and use it as evidence in a paper where you connect it to the overarching course themes (imperialism, capitalism, etc.). I gave myself about two weeks to write up my interview questions, conduct the 30-minute interview, and write my paper and I submitted it days early, so as long as you don't procrastinate, it really shouldn't be too stressful. Exams: There's one midterm and a final. They both consisted of an identifications section where you're given a list of 6 or so terms and you choose 4-5 to define and explain their significance (you're only required to select 4, but if you choose to answer 5, only your top 4 answers will be scored). I was pretty confident about this section, so I only answered the required 4 and used the rest of the time to work on the essay portion of the exams. In this section, you're given a super long, unorganized, and scattered prompt that you might not know what to do with at first. It asks you to include many different, seemingly unconnected things, so I felt like my essays were just as scattered as if I was just spitting out information (think AP exam essays). But it was fine because the TAs are trying to give you points, so as long as you show that you know the material and you use appropriate terms, you'll be fine. To study for the exams, I created and reviewed a Quizlet of important terms (I highly suggest you review all of the Supreme court cases) and I studied all of my lecture and reading notes, but as I mentioned earlier, I feel like the readings weren't all that necessary. After taking the exams, I feel like I could've just studied the lecture notes and passed the exams with few problems. I absolutely DESPISE timed tests with essays, but I finished both the midterm and the final with time to spare, so if that's also true for you, I wouldn't worry about the timed aspect. That's not to say you can take your time on the tests (work urgently, but cautiously), but I had time to draft an outline and write an essay and still finish before the time was up. Discussions: I had Katelyn as my TA, and she was great at communicating with students through email and answering questions. I also greatly appreciated that she took the time to create a list of 50 vocab terms that she recommended we review before the midterm. However, I felt like discussions weren't worth my time. I wanted to review the essential concepts, like lecture-style, but there wasn't much teaching happening in discussions. We just discussed our opinions and observations from the readings and lectures and did free writes. In the discussions right before the midterm and the final, we split into groups to write details about one of 5 main topics, but we used our notes and the Internet, so I don't think I got anything from that that I couldn't get from studying by myself. Finally, there was no suggested timeline given for the research paper, so we were all taken aback when one day Katelyn just asked if any of us had done the interview yet and none of us had. So just be aware that you might want to conduct your interview sometime after the midterm to give yourself ample time to schedule the interview at a convenient time, conduct said interview, and write the paper. Katelyn did give us an outline of questions she used in her interviews, which helped me come up with my questions. Grade scheme: Discussion (20%), Midterm (25%), Final (30%), Research Paper (25%) Tip: Dr. Fong doesn't post her slides online, so you absolutely have to attend class, pay attention, and take notes!"
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,History of Asian Americans,ASIA AM 10,F,"I took this class as GE when I dropped another class I didn't like, so I was two weeks late coming in but I had Mitchell Lee as a TA and he was very helpful in catching me up. There is a book for the class but it isn't a textbook perse. It's very interesting and after the class, I actually intend to keep the book for myself. Fong combines US policy with the Asian American experience and she makes the material relevant. She understands that most history classes are boring because the information is dry and has no personal impact so she makes her lessons with guest speakers and examples of recent history. The grade is comprised of the midterm, final, section participation, and an oral history paper. I went to my TA a lot for help with the paper but even without assistance, it's pretty easy. I didn't read the textbook as much as I should, but the PDFs and going to lecture were the sum of what the tests were about.  The midterm and final are both essay and IDs and they were fairly easy. She doesn't post her slides so going to lecture is crucial in order to get the notes. The slides basically summarize her main points and they are perfect for note-taking. The professor doesn't talk too fast and engages with the class while waiting for people to finish writing.  I recommend this class regardless if you are an Asian American or not because you learn tons of material that is relevant to society's xenophobia today. P.S. there was one extra credit opportunity where the author of the assigned text came to give a talk at Powell, I'm not sure if it'll happen for future classes."
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,History of Asian Americans,ASIA AM 10W,A,the class is point-based with most of the points coming from the midterm/final and the oral history research paper assignment that you work on for the entire quarter. our final for fall 2020 ended up being optional (you could opt to have your midterm score count twice) so it was relatively easy class. there are many extra credit opportunities throughout the quarter which are attending webinars or watching videos and writing a short reflection. would recommend this class with ta emiko if she’s teaching again!!!
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,History of Asian Americans,ASIA AM 10W,A," I took this for my writing II requirement and as a bonus it fulfilled the diversity requirement as well! As with any writing II class, there is a final research paper (8 pgs) but it wasn't very long or difficult. You have weekly short discussion posts and because of the pandemic, she had us write biweekly 350 word informal journal entries talking about what has happened within the past 2 weeks, which gave us a space to discuss anything that has been on our minds, etc. It was worth 10% of our grade and it was easy points! Plus, if you turned it in a little late, both Dr. Fong and the TAs were extremely understanding and would still accept it. The midterm was a short answer question and a long answer question, and she gave us a couple days to complete our tests - both the midterm and final. She's super caring and is very flexible, and she even let us double our midterm score in lieu of the final exam if we wanted! Also, the paper isn't difficult, and she has check points throughout the quarter so you don't get too far behind (which is really helpful for a procrastinator like me). She also spends a couple minutes during the beginning of class for students to talk about anything they'd like (if you want to), and she's very approachable and always offers to help. Overall, I highly recommend the course and Dr. Fong! Grading:Discussion section - 15%Weekly discussion assignment - 15%Journal - 10%Midterm Exam - 15%Final Exam - 15%Research paper - 30%"
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,History of Asian Americans,ASIA AM 10W,N/A," Honestly one of the most meaningful classes I've taken at UCLA. Dr. Fong makes the material personal and relevant and I even know of some people who sat in her lectures - without being officially enrolled - just to learn about Asian American history. Yes, as mentioned below, discussions tend to sway towards the liberal side but that's not unreasonable considering the topic of the class. Be sure to invest time in your final paper and go to office hours with your TA since they are usually awesome resources and tend to be the ones doing most of the grading. Definitely not difficult to get a good grade if you put in the work too!"
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,History of Asian Americans,ASIA AM 10W,A," Seeing as there's no other reviews, I will try to be honest and thorough. This class is offered every spring quarter with very limited spots, and if you get the opportunity to take it, I highly recommend! Takeaways: a broader understanding of Asian American history; if you are Asian American, a greater appreciation of your ethnic background; a lot of GE requirements covered (WII, Foundations of Society and Culture - Historical Analysis, diversity) Teaching style: engaging lecturer, concise slides, appropriate pauses for questions, emphasizes key ideas very clearly (make sure to write down what she says!), laptops permitted only in the front half of the room (don't text or fall asleep, she will call you out!), lectures are NOT posted online and you are NOT allowed to take photos, so pay attention and take notes! Workload:Readings - There is a LOT of assigned readings, the majority were relevant to lecture, but not super necessary for exams. If you are short on time, be sure to at least skim them and grasp the key themes and a few examples that illustrate points from lecture, especially if it discusses a minority population(Short) Presentations - This varies by TA, but mine had us do a 5 minute presentation on a key historical moment and personal history. My friend's TA had her students lead discussion by presenting questions about the reading. However, this isn't anything to stress about. Journal Reflections - You will need to complete 1-2 page reflections on the topics in the readings for 4 weeks. Do this as early as possible. Oral History Paper - You will need to interview a 40+ year old person of Asian descent and use their story as evidence in a 10-page paper that connects it to the overarching course themes (imperialism, immigration, etc.) Be sure to ask Dr. Fong or your TA if you are unsure about any part of the process. Be sure to construct a solid thesis and have body paragraphs that tie back to that thesis. Depending on your person, it may be difficult to flesh out an argument to 10 pages so I advise you to outline thoroughly ahead of time for every paragraph (I ended up having about 11 paragraphs).  Keep in mind that this paper is almost half your grade, so allow enough time for revision and feedback. Midterm/Final:Since this is a writing class, both are formatted such that there are only writing prompts, with one essay and two shorter responses. The essay is the majority of the points. Be sure to complete the study sheet she provides and really think about how to connect the ideas because that will set you up to do well on the essay. The shorter responses are pretty straightforward, just make sure you study your lecture notes and key ideas from the readings well. Course breakdown: Discussion (20%), Midterm (20%), Final (20%), Paper (40%)Good luck!"
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,History of Asian Americans,ASIA AM 10W,A-,"Probably by far one of the worst classes I have ever taken. First off, the amount of liberal propaganda (at least in discussion) is rather sickening. The reading is very repetitive and rarely interesting. Her lectures are pretty useless (pretty much just regurgitates the reading) and she doesn’t post the slides. She’s very reluctant to help students to prepare for the exams. The exams are usually one long essay and 2-3 “short” answers (needs at least two paragraphs). The gradings are completely up to your TA’s and could be somewhat arbitrary. The guest lectures were complete wastes of time. You can definitely find a better writing 2 GE to take"
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,History of Asian Americans,ASIA AM 10W,A," I loved this class! It made me want to minor in Asian American studies. Dr. Fong is an amazing lecturer. It was my first quarter at UCLA and I felt like it was a good introductory course to UCLA. I found the readings fairly interesting and there were multiple extra credit opportunities.  I got an A on the midterm, final, and final paper. If you do the readings, attend lecture and section, and go to your TA's office hours about the paper once, you should be set. I will say that she takes this class seriously so don't take pictures, go on your phone, or sleep — she is not afraid to call you out. I liked that this class fulfilled a GE, diversity, and Writing 2. If you want a class that knocks out some requirements, I would highly, highly recommend. It was definitely my favorite class of the quarter and I loved learning more about the history of Asian American communities because it is not always addressed in other classes."
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,Asian American Movement,ASIA AM 40,A," Dr. Fong is the BEST professor I've had at UCLA! She is the most accommodating professor and an amazing lecturer. Even though this class was online, Dr. Fong made this class super engaging and offered a space for students to connect with each other. She also posted her lecture slides and lecture recordings. Her lectures were well-organized and the readings go hand in hand with the lectures. For the homework, we had readings before each lecture and weekly discussion posts. Each week, there was a discussion prompt and we had to respond to the prompt and reply to 2 of our classmates' posts. Some of the prompts involved a ton of creativity such as creating a short comic or writing a poem. And, we had a journal assignment (300-400 words) every 3 weeks and discussed current events or our life during the pandemic. For discussion sections, we formed groups, and each week, a group presented a summary of the main points of the readings and lead a discussion either in breakout rooms or in the main room. My TA Emily was super kind and very helpful! Also, we were put into small groups to work on the community newspaper, where we focus on events that happened within the Asian American Movement. For the midterm, we had to write 2 essays: 1 short response and 1 long response. We were given 2 days to complete the midterm. Before the midterm, the TAs helped created a study guide, which was super useful for writing. Make sure to be really specific when referring back to the readings. I definitely suggest discussing with other people in the class what to write about! For the final, we were given 2 options: receive the same score as our midterm or do the final, which can only improve your grade. I chose to receive the same midterm score, but there was also an extra credit opportunity for those who chose to do the final.  Overall, I absolutely loved this class and Dr. Fong is so amazing and super accommodating!! If you need a GE, take it with Dr. Fong!!!! :)"
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,Asian American Movement,ASIA AM 40,A," selling pdfs for both textbooks (MOUNTAIN MOVERS & SERVE THE PEOPLE) for $10, contact me @ (714)951-5468 I took this class because I had taken two other Asian AM courses with Dr. Fong and this one was just as great as the other two. The class consisted of two journal entries, weekly discussion posts and replies, discussion section presentation, a group project and a midterm and final. This is combined with weekly readings and lectures which seems a lot but the way Dr. Fong spaces and presents everything is very clear and easy to handle. The journal entries are your space to reflect on anything and they're graded on completion. You also have the opportunity to earn upt o 20 extra credit points by attending Asian AM related events and writing a one page reflection page on it (very easy to get out of the way within the first half of the quarter).   The community newspaper is done in groups of 2-3 and I highly recommend not waiting until the last minute to do it. Each person has the option of writing 2 400-500 word articles or create 2 creative pieces and write one article. Then as a group, you collectively write a 250-300 thematic introduction for your newspaper.  The midterm and final are both give to us over a 48 hour period and includes a short response (~2 pages) and an essay (~5 pages). They were both open notes and online this quarter but I don't know how that'll change in the future.  I don't think AA40 is necessarily an easy A course since you have to keep up with the material (Dr. Fong stops sharing recorded lectures after a week of them being posted). However, it's definitely super interesting and great if you need for GE/AAS minor req.  Grade breakdown:Journals - 100 pointsDiscussion assignments - 150 pointsCommunity Newspaper - 150 pointsGidra Response - 50 pointsDiscussion Section - 150 pointsMidterm - 200 pointsFinal - 200 points"
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,Asian American Movement,ASIA AM 40,B+,Very engaging and nice lecturer and interesting class. Would take again! I wish the lecture recordings and slides weren't deleted after a week though.
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,Asian American Movement,ASIA AM 40,A," Professor Fong is a great professor who really cares about her students and their wellbeing. At the start of the quarter, she sends out a wellness survey that she actually uses to change her teaching style for the quarter, and she makes the final optional (provided that you do well on the midterm). The class itself was quite interesting and made me want to learn more about the Asian American Movement even though I knew nothing about it before. It seems like it'd be even more fun in person due to Dr. Fong's lecture style. The midterm (and final if you take it) are pretty rough due to the length and quality required in such a short time; it's a 2 page short response and a 5 page analytical essay in 75 minutes (2 days for us since it was online). Like other humanities classes, there is a good amount of reading every week (~80 pages), but the homework load is relatively light otherwise. She assigns weekly discussion posts and responses to your classmates' posts, as well as occasional projects. Your grade is determined by the midterm (20%), final (20%), discussion section (15%), Gidra Project (15%), and 2 Journal entries (10%). The Gidra Project is a group project where you make a newspaper, it's a bit of work and is really dependent on how your group works together. Thankfully, grading is quite generous in this class. Overall, I'd recommend this class if you're looking for a fun and interesting GE with a bit of work."
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,Asian American Movement,ASIA AM 40,A," Although this might get mixed reviews for this quarter I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TAKE THIS CLASS!! I am someone who is super interested in learning more about my culture so this class satisfied all of my academic needs. You will learn the background and history of the Asian American Social movement and the way that it came to be - which is knowledge relative to any race.  If you are wondering about the logistics of the class, here they are:  - weekly discussion posts (post your own thoughts and respond to two of your peers) - 15% - participation in discussion section - 15% - midterm (essay format, 48 hours) - 20% - final - 20% - community newspaper group project  *DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND START EARLY - 20% - journals (2) (papers about how you are feeling by learning the knowledge that the prof teaches) - 10%  Professor Fong was so cute and allowed. the class to still be online due to the varying COVID guidelines throughout the quarter. Also, she brought in guest speakers that were extremely intriguing to learn about as they were participating in the movements that we discussed in lecture so you can see your knowledge being applied to real life. Moreover, she would send out email blasts about internships to help out the local Asian American community which is something that truly everyone should consider."
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,Social Science Research Methods,ASIA AM 103,A," SELLING RESEARCH METHODOLOGIES TEXTBOOK FOR $40 (contact @ (714)951-5468) This class consists of participation (which includes leading a group discussion and briefing of weekly chapters), research journals, 3 module assignments, and a group research paper.  Participation points can be achieved by attending class, actively contributing to discussions, and posting to biweekly discussion forum prompts. You are also required to co-host an in class discussion facilitation about weekly readings (super chill and about 20-30 minutes).  Every week, Dr. Fong has you submit a research journal which is about 2-3 pages on your progress with your research paper, questions you have, improvements and goals you have, and a discussion of the most impactful reading of the week.  The module assignments are spaced out throughout the quarter and are relevant to class discussions and the paper. They were very low maintenance but definitely don't leave them to do at the last minute.  There is an interview, self-ethnography, and coding module assignment.  The 18-20 research paper is done in groups of 2-3 and includes a 8-10 minute in class presentation in week 10. It seems like a lot in the beginning but Dr. Fong is always reassuring us of where we should be and addresses our concern in her weekly feedback on our journals. Overall, I highly recommend this class as Dr. Fong is so intelligent and goes above and beyond the create such meaningful conversations about ethnic studies and empowering research and researchers. This is my second time taking a class with her and she is also so understanding to students and gave extensions readily to show her appreciation for our hard work."
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,Social Science Research Methods,ASIA AM 103,A,"I absolutely loved this class! It may seem like a lot of work in the beginning, especially with the large group research paper due at the end of the term, but Dr. Fong breaks down projects and assignments into manageable parts. Dr. Fong is extremely intelligent and cares about her students' performance and well-being. She is always readily available to help and is very communicative. I took a lot away from this class and would most definitely take another class with Dr. Fong in the future!"
Kelly Nicole Fong,NA,Social Science Research Methods,ASIA AM 103,N/A,"Awesome and super engaging class! You spend most of the quarter working on group research projects, and the readings/discussions were all relevant to the project. Dr. Fong is an excellent professor and provides a lot of feedback throughout the quarter. Highly highly recommend taking AAS 103!"
Julienne Bernard,NA,California Archaeology,ANTHRO 113Q,N/A,"I miss this class! I took this class as one of my first classes at UCLA. I was very scared at first, I must admit. Professor Bernard initially spoke really fast and I would sometimes get confused because it was so fast I hardly could write fast enough to match the speed, let alone understand the material. Eventually, as the course went on, she slowed down the pace and the class became really enjoyable. I felt like i know a lot about california indians because of this course. I went to her office hours and she is very approachable and nice. The class set up: 40% midterm 40% final and 20% paper, I think. The material is very interesting if you want to learn about the history of california and the indians who lived and still live here. I absolutely miss this class and it was a very enjoyable experience...I dont miss studying for that midterm, though lol. The class average for the midterm was a C. But dont let that scare you, most of the class did fairly well overall. And from the students i spoke with in class, I got the sense that everyone seemed to like the course or thought it was chill. I would highly recommend this course!"
Cynthia Strathmann,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,N/A,"i took anthropology and the media with strathmann and she was great. she is really nice and very approachable. although the reading got a bit heavy once in a while, it is easy to manage and get a good grade in her class. she is really funny... definitely recommend her as well as the class!"
Cynthia Strathmann,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,N/A,"I took Anthro and the Media from Prof. Strathmann and really enjoyed the class.  There were a few weeks where the reading was overwhelmingly dense, but for the most part it was very manageable. There are two 3-page papers and then a paper at the end where the first two are combined and a third part is added.  Prof. Strathmann was more than willing to discuss my topic with me and help me work through the theory.  As long as you pay attention, the tests aren't too bad.  I'd recommend this class."
Cynthia Strathmann,NA,Anthropology of Religion,ANTHRO 142P,N/A,"She is a very engaging professor, which was a definite plus for an 8:30 am class. I took this class during summer school which made it more rushed that it should have been, but she describes everything very well. If you do the readings, although extensive, and pay attention in lecture, the class is really easy. The grade is divided up between two papers, an in-class project, a midterm and a final. It sort of feels like she makes her tests so easy that she probably laughs at the people who do poorly. A great professor and a great class."
Cynthia Strathmann,NA,Anthropology of Religion,ANTHRO 142P,N/A," I agree with most of the comments written by other students here. I took comparative religion with her and it was the most fun Anthro class I've had. She had us do many interesting group activities in class and the class is worth enrolling in just for that reason. Also, unlike a lot of other professors, Prof Strathmann will actually get back to you on a question you asked her in class that she wasn't sure she knew the answer. I used to think when professors say they will ""look it up"" somewhere it only means they don't know and they dont care because they will never get back to you. But I think Prof Strathmann likes it when you ask her things like that because that way she also learns about new things from her students.  One advice I would give to anyone interested taking her class is use a tape recorder. It will be really useful if you can't write fast or are not able to digest the lecture as you are writing notes quickly because she talks really really fast. You will miss some things she mentions in class no matter how fast you can write, so be sure to ask her to slow down or repeat things once in a while."
S Pelka,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"I loved this class. Professor Pelka is amazing! You do have to read, but they are all interesting readings and the papers aren't bad, they are 2 pages in length. The tests are a breeze and the class is very cool!"
Robert Lemelson,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A+," The class is made up of bi-weekly commentary on the weekly assigned readings, one midterm paper, and a final exam. Throughout the ten weeks of the course, he will conduct 2 pop quizzes, both of which were very easy (I got 100% on both).  Professor Lemelson was engaging throughout most of his lectures. His slides were very straightforward and helpful. The content is pretty interesting if you want to learn more about developing countries, and their cultures through deeper levels. He went to some of the countries and actually presents a lot of his own research in class which is cool. He showed a lot of documentaries in class. The weekly readings are really interesting and very useful. The midterm paper focused on one of the readings, and the final exam was all multiple-choice and completely straightforward. He shared a study guide with the class to help us which was thoughtful.   I would definitely recommend this class if you want an ""easy"" GE. It is not too much work if you stay somewhat on top of the readings and pay attention in the lecture. It's a great class overall."
Robert Lemelson,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A," Prof Lemelson was super nice and was very well informed on the content (he has decades of field/academic experience under his belt). He gave us a lot of anthro content that he actually produced, including films he made that were very interesting as well as some writing he did. This class taps into a lot of ethics in anthro while covering certain topics just because they are so multifaceted. - the reading is a bit dense and there is a lot of it. i did most of them bc he gives pop quizzes and it's good to know big themes/events from the readings to do well. Your TA should cover the readings and main ideas.  - you have to do a presentation during discussion section with a partner on the readings/theme for one of the weeks. it's chill as long as your TA is chill (mine was) - you have one midterm paper and then one final cumulative test (he made the test as straight forward  as possible because he doesn't even like giving tests. He says that he just needs some manageable way to test the knowledge of the hundreds of students in his class) (he provides a detailed study guide).- you have bi-weekly commentaries which are somewhat relaxed writings about the movies and readings/theme you work with those weeks. You are given several prompts and pick the one you want to answer (you only address works from one of the weeks, NOT 2 weeks worth of readings/movies). It is very doable and engaging.  Overall Lemelson is nice and very helpful. He's very open to questions and his lectures were for the most part interesting. Some of the readings and content can be boring but I think the class as a whole is worth it for a GE in comparison to others."
Robert Lemelson,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A+,"This class was fairly easy if you put in some effort. Professor Lemelson is obviously knowledgeable about the subject; he records and writes a lot of the material for the class himself. The class was mostly centered around Indonesian/javanese culture. The topics of the class were really interesting. Professor did two pop quizzes throughout the quarter to ensure attendance, but they were really easy mcq's, if you have even basic knowledge about the class. The final did require a little bit of studying, but a study guide was provided with all the important information. Final was also MCQ. Any topic that I didn't understand was clarified by the TA and the professor. Would take this class again."
Robert Lemelson,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A,"Overall this was an enjoyable class. I feel the one negative thing I have to say is there is A LOT of reading but in most cases you can just skim it (although to be fair I feel the readings Lemelson selected were interesting so at least there's that). The main factor that led me to enjoy this class was the ethnographic films that you watch during about 1/3 of the lectures. The majority of them were actually made by Lemelson who is lowkey a big shot ethnographic film maker, like seriously look him up on google he has a profile and everything. Most of the films center around Indonesian culture which I found to be very interesting. There is a reasonable amount of writing in this class and the final was all multiple choice and did require a decent amount of studying. I took this during the TA strike so I'm not sure if that is the normal final format."
Robert Lemelson,NA,Culture and Human Development,PSYCH 133G,N/A,"professor lemelson really tries to give you a feel for what it would be like as a graduate student. he really tried to engage students and is happy to answer all questions by sometimes turning lectures into a semi discussion type course. there is a separate discussion section to 133G which is also very interesting. the research oral presentation was cake with each group or pair going every week starting week 2. you also have the option of doing 2 medium sized papers or one long paper which is worth a lot of your final grade. there is no final exam!! i had more time to study for my other classes because i chose to do the big paper which was due at week 8. biweekly assignments (2 page mini papers due at discussion) are based on your own commmentatires of the week's readings. i highly recommend taking this class. not only is it easy, you'll learn some interesting things about cultural development."
Robert Lemelson,NA,Culture and Human Development,PSYCH 133G,N/A,"i love the 133G class with Dr. Lemelson. he is not only very organized, very caring about his students but also very stimulating as a lecturer.  i loved going to class and engaging in the class discussions. i would highly recommend this class!"
Robert Lemelson,NA,Culture and Human Development,PSYCH 133G,N/A,"I thought this was a wonderful class. Lemelson is extemely interesting and brings himself to a personal level with his students. He actually takes the time to e-mail the class himself and approaches the learning process differently than any other psychology professor that I have taken at UCLA. There are no crazy multiple choice exams. Only papers and projects, which are not too bad because you always get to choose what you want to write about. Lecture is not mandatory, although every time I went there was always a full house with people sitting on the steps. That shows you that his lectures are pretty interesting. I thought they were! I would suggest this class to anyone. Its been one of my favorites."
Robert Lemelson,NA,Culture and Human Development,PSYCH 133G,N/A,"During these last 4 years, I have not met many professors concerned with student learning. Professor Lemelson is definetly one of these professors. I was not very interested in the material before I took his class, but I did learn alot and I enjoyed what I was learning.  He is an awesome professor who seems to truly care about his students.  UCLA is lucky to have a professor like him."
Robert Lemelson,NA,Introduction to Psychological Anthropology: Historical Development,ANTHRO 136A,N/A,"I am a third year at UCLA, and without reservations I would recommend Professor Lemelson to my friends because I think he must be the best professor I have had at this university.  He was effective as a a teacher because I was engaged in everything his class offered, including lectures and reading materials.  He was concerned about my personal growth and learning because he encouraged to write about something significant to me, instead of taking the safe way out (and analyze Freud, for example).  He guided me to write one of the best papers in my life, and I am quite proud of it.  Lastly, Professor Lemelson class was small, and he made accomodations to be available outside of the classroom for me.  My experience in Anthropology 135A is what all of the college, academic experience should be like."
Robert Lemelson,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,A,"I would recommend him to all of my peers! This is the second course I have taken with professor Lemelson and I hope to take many more with him. He assigns 5 biweekly throughout the quarter, one film review, and one final paper. It is very doable! You have two weeks to write each biweekly. There are no exams in this course."
Robert Lemelson,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,N/A,"Lemelson is a really great professor and very concerned about students and down to talk about almost anything. His only downside is that he can be a little arrogant and firm in his opinions, but never to the point where he disregards the opposition- he argues points very well and is always open to discussion. A great experience"
Robert Lemelson,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,N/A,"I love anthropology but don't really care too much for psychology. (Anthro 137 = Anthropology of Psychological Pathology). Dr. Lemelson is by far one of the very best instructors at UCLA. He knows about many subjects (including what he teaches you) down to the very pin point. Any question you ask him, he'll have an answer. I LOVED THIS CLASS. I highly recommend taking him."
Robert Lemelson,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,N/A,"Swear to God, the best professor I have ever had in my entire college experience. A very intelligent man who is very down to earth and extremely cool. By the end of the class, you will see him as an amazing person as well as a friend. I would highly recomend him to anyone."
Robert Lemelson,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology: Ethnographic Film for Psychological Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,A+,"So, this was an interesting class in that it was not like your traditional course with instruction, quizzes, and exams. The course was more geared around class discussions on various topics which I found very relevant and interesting. He assigns biweeklies, readings, one film review (or deep dive essay pertinent to the readings) as a midterm, and a final paper. If you’re looking for a super easy class this is not it! But if you want to learn and be intellectually stimulated this is the class for you. He’s also very approachable and I felt like he honestly cared to help us when we had questions and concerns. I would definitely recommend this class."
Douglas W Hollan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"This is one of my very favorite classes at UCLA.  Hollan is excellent.  You read the coolest books and actually write fun papers where you get to be an ethnographer and observe others and then write about what you saw.  The papers were the easiest papers I have ever written, very straight-forward.  The subject matter of the course is really good.  Prof. Hollan is super nice and does an excellent job of preparing you for the exam.  Just go to lecture and read and you will ace the class!  If you want to bring up your GPA and are interested in learning about different cultures take this class with Hollan."
Douglas W Hollan,NA,Introduction to Psychological Anthropology: Current Topics and Research,ANTHRO 136B,A+,"This class was is of the most interesting and best classes I have taken at UCLA. We read three books, none of which were too difficult or dense, and wrote an essay about each one plus had two short exams. The essays weren't graded too harshly and the idea was more to engage with the books than to argue a thesis. Hollan is really thoughtful and also works as a psychoanalyst so his approach is pretty fascinating. I got a lot of out of his lectures, and the coursework, not only on an academic level but on a personal level. Some people complained that he does not use slides and does not carefully bullet point concepts in lecture, but it's not really that kind of class, it's more about being legitimately engaged with the materials. My only complaint is that the way he lists out the readings and weekly focuses on the syllabus is pretty confusing!"
Douglas W Hollan,NA,Introduction to Psychological Anthropology: Current Topics and Research,ANTHRO 136B,A," I really enjoyed this class! There were three books we had to read, the first I found a little harder to understand than the later two. After each book we wrote a paper that tied the book to smaller articles that were assigned. The grade breakdown was as follows: Three short essay papers: 70%Two short-in section exams: 20%Discussion Participation: 10% In addition to the papers we had ""short in-section exams."" In reality these were just defining terms from lecture and the articles, super easy!! The lectures were initially not recorded, but he decided to record them a few weeks in. Even though the lectures just consisted of him talking with no powerpoint I found them easy to follow and engaging! Overall, the class did have a good amount of reading, but I thought it was a super interesting and easy class!! Definitely take!!"
Douglas W Hollan,NA,Introduction to Psychological Anthropology: Current Topics and Research,ANTHRO 136B,A,"My TA was awesome, but Hollan's lectures put me to sleep nearly every class."
Douglas W Hollan,NA,Psychoanalysis and Anthropology,ANTHRO 137Q,A," Update: This class has changed to Anthropology 137Q.  Professor Hollan is by far my favorite professor that I have taken at UCLA so far. He is so funny, wise, kind, and a great lecturer. He does not utilize slides and verbally presents his lectures, so if you are someone who can not learn from hearing someone lecture for an hour and a half, this class isn't for you. Aside from adjusting to that, I loved this class! There are three novels that we were required to read and an essay following each one that accounted for 65% of the grade. The midterm (super easy; term and definitions) and final (same format) accounted for 10% each and the remaining 15% of the grade was from participation and attendance in section. He doesn't grade anything himself, so I guess it really depends on who your TA is. Mine was Marissa Berwald and I loved her, favorite TA thus far! Would definitely recommend and I'm hoping to take another class with him."
Douglas W Hollan,NA,Psychoanalysis and Anthropology,ANTHRO 137Q,N/A,"I found his teaching style to be very understanding. He is clearly interested in his subject and gives in depth answers to most questions. Very open to questions and gives good answers. The essay prompts were fairly easy and I ended with a B, I think my TA had more to do with that. "
Douglas W Hollan,NA,Psychoanalysis and Anthropology,ANTHRO 137Q,N/A," This class taught me a lot. His class was scheduled really early in the morning so half the battle was waking up to get there. It is imperative that you attend class because it will highlight the most important things in the readings. He gives you a shit ton of readings to go over. I stopped after four weeks and just focused on the readings that were important to the papers. Most of your grade will be the papers so be sure to do well on them, the TA's don't grade hard, but the concepts require a good amount of understanding to get a good grade.The short exams aren't hard, just skim over the readings and cross examine them with lecture to find key concepts. That's all the short exams are, define key concepts. Nothing to really worry about. The final was the 3rd short paper. Breakdown of Class3 papers2 Short examsSection attendance "
Douglas W Hollan,NA,Psychoanalysis and Anthropology,ANTHRO 137Q,N/A,"Suprised not to see more negative reviews on here. First thing, he does not use lecture slides,he just talks with no particular organization. So if you struggle with auditory learning, you will struggle with this class. Also the class is very paper based, only 20% of your grade comes fron two short exams. Its a little tough to motivate yourself when you don't need the lectures for the papers, just the exams, leading to a lot of grades being dragged down by really bad exam scores. The exams are very short so forgetting something minor results in a very low grade on the exam. Not my favorite class, though not my least either. You might want to consider beforehand how seriously you take psychoanalysis."
Nicholas Gessler,NA,Structure of Physical Reality,HNRS 67,N/A,"I took professor Gessler for his Honors 67 Artificial Life and Culture class.  I found the class to be very interesting.  Professor Gessler was very concerned about student learning, and did a good job teaching students of all different levels how to program and about the various ALICE topics.  I would definitely recommend professor Gessler in the future, especially if he is teaching any cryptography classes(there are rumors)"
Nicholas Gessler,NA,Artificial Life and Evolutionary Design: Theory and Practice in Multiagent Modeling,HNRS 69,N/A,"This guy was great. He hates tests. I remember coming to class one day, and they had set up the classroom with white voting-style boxes. Nick said something like ""I can't believe they would use MY classroom for giving TESTS!"". Coincedentally, we didn't have to take a single test. All you have to do is show up every day and participate. I got an A and I expect the rest of the class did as well. Just come and try your best and Gessler will teach you something interesting."
Nicholas Gessler,NA,Artificial Life and Evolutionary Design: Theory and Practice in Multiagent Modeling,HNRS 69,N/A," Artificial Life, Culture, and Evolution has been my favorite class out of the ones I've taken during my first three years at UCLA!  It touches upon evolutionary programming, cryptology, building simulations, and many other interesting subjects that have only recently entered our world thanks to technology and computing. The class is also designed so that even people unfamiliar with programming can learn without difficulties, while others with experience can work on a project that further pushes their limits of creativity. It is also likely to provide ideas and resources that could let you explore areas that would be otherwise difficult to find on your own. At the same time, Nick Gessler's guidance, knowledge, and amiable personality greatly complement the social community aspects of the class. It's a pleasure to find a professor who really does care about what you have to say!"
Nicholas Gessler,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,N/A,"Given the opportunity, you should definitely take either of these classes with Professor Gessler.  The classes are very interesting and give you a chance to use computers for something more fun than most classes and Professor Gessler really makes an effort to try to keep everyone up to speed.  Take the course and you won't regret it."
Nicholas Gessler,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,N/A,"Prof Gessler was a really amazing instructor - the best!  I came to the class not knowing what to expect, and was confronted with a course based entirely on computer programming, which I know nothing about.  I struggled through the first few programming challenges, and went to him at midterms, thinking I would have to drop the class.  He encouraged me to stick it out, and I ended up with an A+.  I did need to work with him outside of class on my final project, but he was always available and interested in what I was trying to do.  Unless you have some basic knowledge of C++, it is essential that you come to every class, or you'll can get lost and never really catch up.  Highly recommended!"
Nicholas Gessler,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,N/A," I thought professor Gessler was one of the best professors I've ever had at UCLA.  I took him for Anthro 137 and I did not know one thing about programming, but he was very patient with all of his students and every single student presented a project that was developed with Borland's C++ programing.   His T.A., Dave, was phenomenal also.  They were both extremely helpful and I asked them for a LOT of help.  They were both willing to meet me outside of class or an hour before class or after.  They were extremely helpful in making the computer programming easy.  The class was very exciting and one of the things I admired most about prof. Gessler is he didn't have us spend a lot of money on a lot of different books.  A lot of times he brought copies of reading material in to the class.   He was very organized; I always knew what was expected of me ahead of time and he was ALWAYS available to help; during class and after class hours.  I would highly recommend students take his class to get a breath of realism and a professor that is just a great down to earth kind of guy.  He might even invite you to go hunting with him for meteorites; the guy really cares about his students and there are no tricks or surprises."
Nicholas Gessler,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,N/A,"Prof. Gessler was great! He was always there to lend a hand whenever anyone needed help on their simulation. There's not that much reading, other than the small amount of required readings for participation.  He's really nice and cool, and I wish there was more professors like him.  He's really into his subject, which is great because as an anthro major I had no clue what to expect the class was about.  But I did learn many small aspects of programming and also to know that C++ is not my thing, but I do recommend Gessler because nothing gets better than his class. He's really cool and laid back."
Nicholas Gessler,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,N/A,"This class was terrific. It had no tests, just projects and online postings. And the projects are very interesting. I learned how to program with c++. Gessler makes it easy by showing you how it works. He also lets you take code from existing projects and put it in yours. We also spent a lot of time watching videos about robots and AI. We even took a field trip to a robotics lab. If you wanna learn something new, I suggest you take one of his classes."
Nicholas Gessler,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,N/A,"I'm a computer science student, and I took his class because I needed something to fill my schedule out and figured this would be cake.  It turned out I learned all the fun stuff that I never get to do in my classes.  Take his class, you'll enjoy it."
Nicholas Gessler,NA,Cartography,GEOG 167,N/A,"I was glad to meet a great professor at UCLA.I really enjoyed attending his computer class.Even though I did not know about programming at all, he always helped me closely. Always I could see how he cared and considered of students' learning. At the same time, he always encouraged students. I had a great time to attend his lecture because I learned 'compute programming' a lot!!!! I really want to say ""thank you"" to him.In addition, I really recommend to take his class. YOU WILL ENJOY CREATING YOUR OWN PROGRAMMING AND YOU WILL LEARN A LOT!!!When I get a chance, I definately will continue studying of computer with his lecture^^\305B"
Nicholas Gessler,NA,Advanced Honors Seminars,DESMA 189,N/A," DESMA 189 was one of the most fun, engaging classes I have taken at UCLA!  Professor Gessler\355s course is innovative and distinct, combining programming (Borland C++) with arts/media design as well as social science.  One of his class demonstrations, for example, included little human figurines mounted on stepper motors, which were programmed to \354meet and greet\356 each other.  In fact, I looked forward to going to every lecture because he would have a different demonstration each time, ranging from a wind chime that would *ping* when hit by solenoid rods (it could actually play the scales) to a telephone that would display the photo of whichever student\355s name was being dialed up on the computer screen.   In addition to each demonstration at the beginning of every class, Professor Gessler would also eagerly introduce us to new mediums\363like fiber optic cables, light emitting diodes (LEDs), and many other devices we could potentially use in our own projects.  And, I really enjoyed the demonstrations on cellular automata and the video in which various computer generated organisms evolved.  Not only are subjects, which Professor Gessler teaches very unique but so is his approach.  He gives his students a lot of freedom to be creative, yet provides enough guidance to ensure the student is not lost, helping each student find and develop their own interest (I considered an incredibly refreshing break from the typically rigid social science classes).  In the very first class, for example, Professor Gessler made clear that the structure of the class was flexible and would be adjusted to accommodate our interests.   Further, Professor Gessler is exceptionally understanding, generous and patient.  As a Political Science student, I had no idea how to program when I entered his class.  But, Professor Gessler devoted a great deal of time and patience to me.  He spent roughly one to two hours with me each week outside of class to help me learn C++ and figure out very basic things\363such as how a stepper motor works.  And, I feel the evidence of Professor Gessler\355s excellent teaching is evident through the finished work of his students, which included a fern that would seek light while unrolling its leaves to Christmas lights that would flash at different speeds depending on how it was approached and\363not to forget my project\363a fiber optics flower that would spin at various speeds and directions and change colors depending on one\355s distance to the infrared sensors.  And imagine\363I had no previous programming experience!  I strongly suggest you take at least one class with Professor Gessler before graduating at UCLA.  I guarantee a wonderful, fun learning experience!"
Dario Nardi,NA,"Artificial Intelligence: Machines as People, People as Machines",HNRS 25,N/A,"AI is a tough topic to teach due to its reliance on many disciplines from computer science, to philosophy and neuroscience.  This class discusses theories, challenges and advancements in the field of AI, and offers students hands on experience with how an AI system may be developed.  There is a lot of material to learn, and naturally a class which covers most aspects of such a vast topic requires a lot of reading and effort.  The Social Bot project at the end of the quarter can be quite challenging and time consuming, but it is very rewarding. I don\355t know of another class that allows their students to learn so much about so many different fields in one class (i.e. from the structure and regulation of neurons to learning a computer programming language \361 Perl). This class is a perfect example of a class which demonstrates a clear proportionality between the amount of effort on the student's part, the knowledge gained and grade received.  Don't rely on this board to determine if Professor Dario is an easy or hard teacher, take his class if you're interested in the subject and what he has to offer, which is a lot.   The topics covered in this class and the lectures given correlate closely with the course text book (Mind, Introduction to Cognitive Science, MIT press). I recommend reading the chapters covered before coming to class, and outlining all information in the book for every chapter.  Although deep involvement in any one discipline of the course can be cumbersome due to time restrictions, this class is designed to sufficiently go over the material involved without complicating the subject matter with unnecessary detail.  I felt that Professor Dario provided an excellent introduction to the field of AI, and would recommend him to all students truly interested in the topic. Professor Dario makes the topic quite manageable by offering clear explanations for all the topics involved.  He is one of the best professors I\355ve taken at UCLA."
Dario Nardi,NA,"Artificial Intelligence: Machines as People, People as Machines",HNRS 25,N/A,"This class was sort of like a very, very dumbed down version of introduction to cognitive science.  A lot of what he ""teaches"" the class seems to be based off of his own personal opinions and philosophies rather than proven science.  However, his tests and assignments are very easy (probably because he never teaches much of anything of substance in the first place) so I would recommend taking him if you're looking for an easy A."
Dario Nardi,NA,"Artificial Intelligence: Machines as People, People as Machines",HNRS 25,N/A,"Prof. Dario is absolutely wonderful! He was entertaining and engaging, two things many of faculty here at UCLA are lacking. He is one of the best professors I've had during my college career, and the course I took with him was certainly one of the most interesting. He really seems to care a lot about his students, and is always sympathetic if someone is sick or can't make it in to class. He is easy to relate to and lectures very well. I highly recommend taking a course with him!"
Dario Nardi,NA,Systems Thinking: Exploring Order and Chaos in Everyday Life,HNRS 68,N/A,"it was an extremely interesting class.  being my last class of the day (after 3 sciences), you would think i would be dead - but, he was quite captivating and made the entire class interesting.  he cares a lot about his students and is easy to pay attention to because of his animated discussions.  definitely the best class i've taken at ucla."
Dario Nardi,NA,"Culture, Gender, Sexuality",ANTHRO 145S,N/A," OK-- I did not take Anthropology 134 with Dr. Nardi, but Bruinwalk doesn't have Honors Collegium 25, so I randomly selected whatever course. Honors 25 is basically a programming class, and that's what your homework is going to be, working with html and javascript. Some are challenging, but mostly they don't end up complicated, because Dr. Nardi helps you with them. Just ask. Btw, he is very nice and is also easy on the eyes. The thing that I didn't like about his class is the grading. We never knew the grades we got per assignment. His exams are also a little hard to study for. On the midterm I got an A- (it was a computer-based exam that was quite confusing, and the average was pretty low on it). Never knew what I got on the final, although after toiling on the book (the textbook was a little boring), and with Nardi's book (I liked this one, it was an easy read), I'm pretty sure I did very, very well on that final. I ended up with an A- in the class. I wish I got an A, but hey, A- is cool."
Dario Nardi,NA,Formal Modeling and Simulations in Social Sciences,ANTHRO M186,N/A,"What a great way to get honors credit and learn a lot! This class was a lot of fun and was not too stressful, except that I took it over the summer so things moved pretty fast. Dario is a good lecturer - he is quirky, funny and a master of his field. We did 2 class simulations outside, wrote 2 papers and ended with a final research paper. Everything we did in the course was both relevant and revealing. I highly recommend taking this class."
Dario Nardi,NA,Formal Modeling and Simulations in Social Sciences,ANTHRO M186,N/A,"Great, interesting class. Prof Nardi is just an AWESOME guy and my favorite professor at UCLA thus far. Just follow his study guide, gives extra credit, interesting material, and you should get your A. =)"
Dario Nardi,NA,Formal Modeling and Simulations in Social Sciences,ANTHRO M186,N/A,"Cool Professor. Nice, funny, and entertaining. Helps you out and is clear when teaching. Really learn alot of interesting stuff. And hes not a dick about grading and gives extra credit. Highly recommend."
Dario Nardi,NA,Formal Modeling and Simulations in Social Sciences,ANTHRO M186,N/A,"I don't have enough good things to say about Professor Nardi. It is obviously a bit annoying we have to pay for a reader he made, but nonetheless, that reader will SAVE YOUR LIFE! If you have the reader, you don't really have to go to lecture. But if you don't have the reader, you will have to go to lecture and still find access to the reader because you need it for the tests/quizez. I also need to mention it is the best structured reader I've ever read so you get your money's worth. The way the class is graded is 10% participation (from stimulations we do. Answer questions and turn in to him), 30% final paper (which was actually extremely interesting and not too time consuming), and 60% tests (20% for each of the 3). I did not go to class much (I was taking 4 classes who were kicking my butt) but I must admit that everytime I did, I truly enjoyed it. I wish I had the time that quarter because the things he would bring up in class were so interesting. Anyways, point being is... TAKE THIS CLASS! You won't regret it!"
Dario Nardi,NA,Formal Modeling and Simulations in Social Sciences,ANTHRO M186,N/A," I took Hum CS M100 (same as anthro m186) and Hum CS 100L with Professor Nardi in the winter 2009 quarter.Professor Nardi is wonderful, knows a lot about the material, and best of all, actually cares about student learning.  Go to his office hours to talk to him; he's super nice/funny and more than willing to help you. :) Hum CS M100: Loved the class, learned a lot.  Logistics first: You have 2-3 assignments that you have to do, usually around 5 pages double spaced; they're basically just write-ups of the simulations that you did in class.  They're really not bad, and the questions he asks are more for you (what did you learn?  what did you think?).  Just follow the instructions, and you're good to go.Exams: There are 3 ONLINE exams that you take, each worth about 20% (if I remember correctly).  Many students I talked to complained how many of the questions (especially in the first exam) seemed more subjective than objective, making it ultimately kind of hard to pick answers (some of the questions allowed you to check more than one box, or all/none of the above...GAH!!!).  Overall though, I think it evens out because everyone ends up getting the grade they deserve, as Professor Nardi curves the overall grades after.  Oh, and they're open book.  :)  (Don't be fooled though, the exams are not easy.)Final Paper:  Two words - START EARLY.  It is very time consuming, as you have to gather data/run experiments.  It's really not that hard, but it just takes a while.  He is very, very willing to help, so ask him if you have any questions. Hum CS 100L: This 1-unit lab definitely requires more work than a 1 unit class should... But whatever, I still liked it (it's not that bad).  I won't ruin the experiment you run for the duration of the class, but just be prepared to write 2-3 papers for this class as well.  Not much to say.  Pretty easy A if you just do what he asks you to do."
Dario Nardi,NA,Formal Modeling and Simulations in Social Sciences,ANTHRO M186,N/A," Dario is a unusual professor. His teaching style is one of the most non-traditional types.  He has something what we call charisma because his students fell in love with his laid back teaching style, his friendliness and flexibility with students. He was always surrounded by a group of students when the lecture was over.  All his lectures were contained in a 90+ page course pack which was concise, straight forward, and extrmely helpful because students' time was greatly saved from those traditional long, and boring reading assignments, which probably had nothing to do with the course itself. Those life simulations were enjoyable. Quizzes were straight forward and all drawn from the course pack.   Homework assignments could be frustrating and time consuming but you would learn if you did all your work.  Dario was a generous grader - he gave out 40% As. Your effort would be rewarded.  On the whole, it was a great class taught by a nice professor who inspired students to think and to look at the real world analytically."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Fairly easy class. As mentioned by many people, the required reading is tediously long and absolutely pointless. All you need to do is memorize his lecture slides while focusing especially on mundane details such as site names, locations, and dates. The two papers are essentially summarizing and comparing/contrasting two articles on a specific topic."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Even though I ended up getting an A- this class stressed me out more than my upper division science classes. The information presented in class is not that difficult, but the amount of useless reading assigned is huge, discussion sections are mandatory and a waste of time and the papers are a waste of time, since you basically have to summarize archaeological articles. Brantingham posts lecture slides after the lecture, I think it would have been more useful to have them during lecture. Overall I would not recommend the class to my friends"
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Dr. B is very entertaining and enthusiastic about archaeology, and this clearly shows in his lectures. He is definitely better than the other prof who teaches the class, Dr. Smith. Do NOT read the book. Do memorize every slide. If you know the concepts of lecture you have an 80% on his exams. To get the other 20% you have to memorize many dates and places. As previously said, the papers are really easy; majority of the class gets an A on those. You'll earn your A in the class from knowing every date and place mentioned in lecture. Don't skip class either because he gives away test questions on low turnout days (ie day before thanksgiving). Good luck in the class and your future endeavors."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,His a good teacher.  Study the power points.  Know dates and sites.  The questions on both the midterm and final are very detailed questions.  The papers are very easy.
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Class is easy, just flash card the slides and study them. There are two papers in the class both only take about two hours to write each. Section is mandatory, but a waste of time. He has really good communication skills, but I wish he would of incorporated more interesting facts, but o well, just a GE."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Very interesting class, actually. One of the major advantages of this class compared to many anthro classes is that Dr. Brantingham posts all the powerpoint slides, and if you just listen to his lectures and study his slides very well, you will get and A for sure. Honestly, this class is not hard at all, I was taking Biochem153A (Bates) and EEB 130 along with this class and I still managed to get a B+ (I did not study hard for this class). Another thing to mention about this class is that he chooses the best TAs. Anyway, at the end you would learn a lot of interesting facts about the human past and get a very good grade. What else do you want?"
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"He is the bomb... class is interesting and he is a really good proffesor, i learned alot... btw only study lecture slides"
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"I loved his course! His lectures are actually interesting, and Professor Brantingham is a really nice, funny guy overall. He throws in bits of humor, and his research is really intriguing. It wasn't too difficult of a class, but definitely keep up on the readings and you'll do fine. All his notes are online, and definitely go to his office hours and talk to the TAs about your papers before they're due. They're short papers, but the topics are actually cool and if you have your TA review a rough draft, your grade should be fine. Brantingham is definitely a great anthro professor! I thoroughly enjoyed his class."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"this is THE best professor I have had thus far. Brantingham is EXTREMELY approacheable, interested in student learning, organized and knowledgeable. outlines of his lecture are generally posted prior to class, and full slides are posted online after the lecture. The material is very very interesting as well, and I don't know what people are talking about when they say to not take this class as a GE because of the memorization; this class is EASY! brantingham is really lenient it seems with the grades; there are no curves, but that's good because i think 50% (at least )of the class gets an A on each assignment"
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"What an amazing professor!  What an amazing class!  Do your work, go to class and you will do well.  Don't listen to old reviews.  These people never went to class and didn't put an effor to do well in the class.  Professor Brantingham is very helpful, enthusiastic and has a very interesting class.  Study and you will do well.  Don't study and you won't do well.  Thank you so much Professor Brantingham for such a wonderful class and experience."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Professor Branting is an awesome lecturer. The class itself has a lot of information and reading, but on the whole is worth it if you are interested in the topic. He is very organized and to the point and welcomes students outside of class. Take this class if you want something interesting."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Anthro 8 is an extremely boring and taxing class. There is a ton of memorization which overshadows some otherwise interesting concepts. Brantingham focuses on key dates and sites on his midterm and finals. The papers are doable as long as you see your TA before you turn in the assignment. My advice would be not to take this class as a GE because many hours will be spent memorizing useless information. Brantingham is incredibly benevolent and willing to help, however, the class will bore you to death."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A," Things to like: powerpoint lectures, knowledgeable and enthusiastic professor, approachable, and very concerned about student learning. Things to dislike: Sometimes can be boring Overall, I think it would be just fine to take Brantingham. Compared to other professors, he's takeable. And he's a nice guy."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Prof. Brantingham is an enthusiastic lecturer and knows his stuff.  He's approachable and always glad to see students at office hours.  He encourages students to talk about their paper, as do the TAs, and will offer helpful tips on how to improve it.  Anthro 8 covers a lot of material though, which makes studying for exams difficult if you're not good at memorization.  Also, he assigns a lot of readings from the textbook, but you really only need to study/memorize his lecture notes to do well on exams.  I don't recommend this course as a G.E. for people who aren't interested in the archaeology of human evolution (mostly hominid sites and first agriculturers are discussed) because lectures and readings will be dull if you're not into the topic.  However, I think the structure of the course is a great intro for students who wish to get into the field."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Very fascinating class!  I learned so much about the rise and development of humans.  Brantingham is a good professor.  He says ""um"" rather often which can be distracting during lectures but in general he gets across the information.  Be prepared for a lot of info!  Dates and time periods are essential to remember; not a good course for those who hate memorizing dates.  Brantingham is a very amiable person and truly is passionate about his field and sharing this with students.  The TAs and Brantingham are nice about grades although he did not curve the final which was very difficult.  If this subject interests you at all this is a very worthwhile class."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A," strenghths: knowledgeable, concerned with student learning, encourages interaction outside of classroom, extremely organized, good communicator, very passionate about subject. weaknesses: routine, very structured environment for learning Recommended for anthro majors...make sure you're somewhat interested in archaelogy if you want to take this as a GE because intro to arch covers a very broad depth of material."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Three words: Brantingham is awesome. The fact that he's a junior professor might be the driving factor backing his concern for student learning. Never have I encountered a professor who actually asks for more students to come to his office hours! His lecture style is concise, yet thorough and although he often runs of out time, all of the slides are posted on the web almost immediately after the lecture is over. If you have the chance, take an honors discussion with him. He's very knowledgable about his field and is willing to share it with eager students. As far as exams go, they're difficult to study for because of the wealth of information presented, but rather reasonable in retrospect. You'll generally receive as much help on papers as you ask for. In other words, don't be lazy and wait until the week before it's due to ask for help. It ain't gonna happen. Anyway, I think someone should just let him know what a great job he's doing, especially as a newbie. Don't believe me? Take one of his classes and see for yourself."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Principles of Archaeology,ANTHRO 110,N/A,"Prof. Brantingham is a reasonable and fair teacher. His class was not super hard but was not super easy. Reading the book is not required, but I would recommend it. It helps on 3-5 questions of the midterm. The outside readings are pointless, do not bother. I received an A in his class but I did study and I did spend time writing my paper. His tests are aimed at testing if you can apply the knowledge you learned, rather than just straight facts and memorization. Don't bother taking notes, just listen to the lecture and print out the slides to study. "
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Principles of Archaeology,ANTHRO 110,N/A,"Dr. B is an amazing professor! He manages to make even the driest subject matter interesting because he is a great lecturer! The guy is incredibly smart but not in a stuffy kind of way, and he has a great sense of humor. His lectures are organized, dynamic, and easy to understand, and he also posts everything in case you missed something. You also don't have to do the readings to score high on the exams, though it doesn't hurt to at least scan the book. I would definitely recommend taking any class with him. His exams are not easy and you are certainly expected to think about the material, but if you go to class and take notes you will do fine! "
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Principles of Archaeology,ANTHRO 110,N/A," He's awesome. You can choose not to take the final if you do well on the midterm and on the research paper. This means that (assuming you do) after week 7, it's just sweet cruisin'! What's cool about him:-always has the right popular culture reference to back up a concept-looks EXACTLY like the singer Michael McDonald On second thought...I think it WAS McDonald all along."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Principles of Archaeology,ANTHRO 110,N/A,"Very engaging and entertaining lecturer. Lectures from Powerpoint presentations and posts them online after class. A lot of assigned reading, but never comes play during class. Very easy to get an A-/B+ on the multiple choice midterm and final if you just memorize the Powerpoint lectures (and forgo the readings). One research paper due a couple of weeks before the final. Final grade in the class is the average of your highest two grades (from the midterm, paper, and final)."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Old Stone Age Archaeology,ANTHRO 112,N/A,"Hes a very good professor. Class is based on two highest grades there is an optional research paper, midterm, and final.  Theres a lot of readings but they aren't necessary. He tests off the powerpoints from lecture which he puts up online.  The only bad thing is he goes through the slides pretty fast so you have to take notes on just what he says and go back and look at the slides whole studying.Overall hes very good and keeps its somewhat entertaining considereing hes lecturing about pretty boring stuff."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Old Stone Age Archaeology,ANTHRO 112,N/A," the entire class in based on powerpoint lectures. he posts the slides the night before, so you can print it out and write notes on it. i made the mistake of studying the textbook for the final and failed the midterm. the paper is 8-10 pages and the final was optional. i took it because i failed the MT. the good thing is, there are only two things to do in class, both 50% of your grade and if you mess up, you can take the final to make it up (i got a C+ in the class) i thought the class was really boring and ended up not going at all. he's a brilliant guy, but i can only do powerpoint for so long before going ADD. an advice from me: memorize the slides and get the main points from the online readings and you'll ace his multiple choice tests."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Old Stone Age Archaeology,ANTHRO 112,N/A,Amazing professor. He is very organized and is always available when you have questions. I got a lot out of the course and got a an A. You'll enjoy it regardless if you are interested in the subject. Definitely consider taking this course!
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Old Stone Age Archaeology,ANTHRO 112,N/A,Amazing teacher! I would definitely recommend him to anyone! Just have to work really hard upfront and it will pay off later in the course.
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Archaeology of South Asia,ANTHRO 116,N/A,"This review is for Anthropology 116P Archaeology of Prehistoric China. I really enjoyed this class.  Archaeology in china is interesting because there is so much to it. Professor Brantingham is an enthusiastic speaking and great presenter.He also is happy to help his students at any time. His class is based on a midterm and a final with an optional paper. The class is only hard if you do not study. Like all Archaeology classes you have to memorize dates, names, etc... If you study hard enough though you can get a good grade, it really was not that difficult. The names are in Chinese and are a bit challenging to memorize but it is nothing to complain about. I recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in Archaeology in general. You will be presented with fascinating new ideas about the evolution of culture in China."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Archaeology of South Asia,ANTHRO 116,N/A," This class is the last Archaeology class I'll ever have to take to fulfill my Major requirements & I had hoped that it would be slightly interesting, but I also had a feeling I'd be using the internet to waste time too. Archaeology of Prehistoric China was incredibly dull. The material is dull. There is nothing exciting about this class & it's not that I dislike Archaeology, it's that China & some of its neighbors aren't nearly as interesting as the cave paintings in France.  P. Brantingham reminds me of an aged Ted Mosby from How I Met Your Mother as his enthusiasm for Prehistoric China is equivalent to Ted's enthusiasm for Architecture. However, this course's materials were incredibly dry. The readings worked better than a shot of Nyquil & all of the site names got incredibly confusing after a while. I don't mean to be racist against the Chinese as I'm Asian myself, but Longshan, Yangzi, Yangshao, Dawenkou, Rhenzidong, Bashidong, Mao Zedong, Dapengkeng, Majabang, Hemudu seriously start to sound like ""chingchongdong"", ""chongchongdingdong"", & likewise.  He changes the spelling of the main river that runs through China called Yangzi. One slide he'll call it Yanzte & another he'll call it Yangzi. Since I am unfamiliar with any dialect of Chinese, for some time, I didn't know if there was a difference between the two or if they were the same & he was just messin' with us. He also left out the ""g"" in Dapengkeng for the first 5 or so slides which also threw me off a bit.  If you plan on taking this class, here are my tips:-Dates & sites. Make flashcards, whatever, study the dates, sites, & what was found there. Memorize it.-The term ""big picture"" is such a load of dung. He specifically asks you what were found at certain sites.-Record his lectures. He doesn't have podcasts & his powerpoints may outline everything, but they lack great detail. There will be pictures of up Einstein or Trinity from The Matrix in his slides & if you didn't attend lecture, you'll be scratching your head on the relevance. -Pay attention in class so you can ask questions.-Skip the readings & save yourself some time. His midterm asked 1 question from the reading & he already discussed the answer in class. The final had 0 questions on the reading. -Do the optional paper if you fail the midterm. His exams are so detailed.-Memorize the location of the sites on a map.-Pottery is more than symbolic, you'll need to pay close attention to them. Two grades split 50%-%50%. Midterm grade & final grade. He doesn't curve the class at all so every point counts. This class's high points were the discoveries of H. erectus in the caves & the discussion of modern human origins. The low points were pretty much everything else. Sure I learned some interesting things about China, the evolution of Homo, monsoons, & how cultivation of rice was only possible in the Holocene, but this isn't a class I'd recommend. P. Brantingham is a really nice guy & he seems to be very helpful if you go to his office hours. He's more than meets the eye. Your immediate thoughts are, ""Oh another dirt guy..."" but you'd be dead wrong! He has developed a system with some mathematicians at UCLA to come up with a projection of possible criminal activity before it happens based on patterns.  The material is boring, professor is really cool, but I wouldn't recommend this class. Brantingham is a very objective Archaeologist which allows you to get a different point of view other than those of Chinese Archaeologists. "
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Archaeology of South Asia,ANTHRO 116,N/A," This review is for Anthro 116P:  Archaeology of Prehistoric China. This was the first anthro class I have taken that I did not enjoy, probably because it felt like a history class instead of an anthro class.  Brantingham is a nice guy and a great speaker--he just presents the material as a list of facts.  And that's all you're tested on.  Cold, hard, facts.  You end up having to memorize hundreds and hundreds of dates, archaeological sites, their names, locations, what was discovered there, etc.  It is a LOT of material.  I've never been good at memorizing--I'm a conceptual learning, hence why I'm an anthropology major.  However, with this class, it doesn't matter if you understand the concepts because that'll only get you through about 10% of his tests.  What makes it harder is that all the archaeological sites have Chinese names, so it's not what we're used to seeing therefore extremely difficult to remember when they all look the same.  I'm not being ignorant:  I am fluent in Chinese, but seeing 40 multiple choice questions all containing names like Shuidonghou, Zhoukoudian, Dawenkou, Duonguoluo, etc... it all really just looks the same after a while.  It's fine learning it lecture by lecture, but when you go to take a cumulative final exam, it's extremely difficult to keep straight, regardless of how much you study. Also, the tests would be much less stressful if he gave some guidance on what topics and sites to focus on.  He tells you nothing.  So, you're pretty much expected to remember every fact and figure he mentions in class.  The class is also not curved.  The mean on the midterm was 75%, which isn't failing, but not the grade the majority of the class should be getting.  He's also extremely unaccessible.  He says he will be in his office, and I've stopped by several times within a two week period of time to pick up the midterm, and he was not there.  Definitely would have helped to have that for the final... also, he pretty much never answers e-mails, so you literally have to wait in line after or before class to talk to him. Also, he does post his lecture slides online, but they're not that great.  It's one of those things where if you missed an important definition he gave out in class, you would have to find someone else in the class for it because his lecture slide would only have the word, probably some dates, and a picture.  His summary slides also don't tell you much either.  His lecture slides pretty much are a skeleton of his lectures, presented as if there were just notes to himself on what to say. I wish he had more resources, such as a discussion board where students can ask and answer questions.  Also, I would have appreciated it if he never said ""just focus on the big picture"" because that is certainly not the case on his exams.  It's extremely misleading. What I thought would be a fairly easy, enjoyable class, turned out to be my worst nightmare.  His tests were harder than the tests I took for a Life Science class on genetics this quarter.  Unless you're really good at memorizing mundane facts, don't take Brantingham.  I loved anthro 8 with a different professor, so it's not that I don't like archaeology.  It's just that this class, as I said, did not feel like an anthro class at all. That's just my two cents."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Archaeology of South Asia,ANTHRO 116P,N/A,"Two Exams and a Paper. The Paper can replace the final exam if you score high enough, which he doesn't hand any grade lower than a B unless you didn't try at all. Score well on the first exam, finish the paper, then you're done during sixth week. Sweet"
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Selected Topics in Social Anthropology,ANTHRO 149,A+,"Writing for ANTHRO 169, Ecology of Crime. Prof Brantingham is a funny and engaging lecturer. Your grade is determined by 2 out of 3 assignments, 50% each: midterm (mandatory), essay (optional), and final (optional). The midterm and final were both multiple choice, a breeze if you study go over his slides and bruincasted lectures. Overall, the content is very interesting too."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Selected Topics in Social Anthropology,ANTHRO 149,A,"Really enjoyed this course! Attendance is not mandatory and the professor BruinCasts the class. Your grade is based on a midterm, final, and optional paper. If you do the paper and are happy with your grade, then you don't have to take the final. I decided to do the midterm and final. The exams were straightforward and easy as long as you paid attention during lecture or listened to his BruinCasts. I started studying 3-4 days before the midterm and final and listened to the class recordings and read the lecture slides. Make sure you understand the big picture of the lecture and the examples he discusses and you should do well on the exams!"
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Selected Topics in Social Anthropology,ANTHRO 149,A-," So I took a class with the same time conflict/final time as this class. I went to this class once (just the day of the midterm exam) and ended up getting an A- in the class. I received a 42/45 on the midterm, studying only 3-4 days before the final. I watched all of the lectures on BruinCast and used the slides to follow his talking. All of my friends who read the textbook didn't do as well. Trust me and just use BruinCast and his slides to study. I then did the research paper and I got an 88% on it. Since I couldn't take the final, which I'm sure I would've got an A in, I ended up getting an A- in the class, as it was the average of the midterm and research paper for me. The class is graded on 2 out of these 3 things:1. Midterm2. Research Paper3. Final The 2 highest grades are taken for your final grade and each will be worth 50%."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Selected Topics in Social Anthropology,ANTHRO 149,A-,"Amazing professor! He makes himself very available and is clear in his expectations. I honestly wish the class was a whole semester because there is so much material I would have loved to go over in more detail. I imagine his other classes are just as engaging. Regardless of whether you are an Anthro major/minor,  or are just looking for a course to fulfill an elective, take Brantingham,"
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Selected Topics in Social Anthropology,ANTHRO 149,A-," This is for Brantingham's Ecology of Crime course.  He does an amazing job as a lecturer and professor, super helpful in office hours and excited to teach.  Class has 2 required assignments (50% midterm and 50% final).  He has an optional paper too.  If you do the paper, and are happy between that and your midterm grade, you don't to take the final.  In my case, I wrote the paper to exclude my midterm grade.  I realistically got an 89% and still bumped to an A-!"
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Selected Topics in Social Anthropology,ANTHRO 149,A,"Professor Brantingham has been my favorite professor at UCLA! I wish he taught more classes than 157 - Ecology of Crime. If  you keep up with the lectures, either in class or online, you'll do fine in the class. There is a midterm and final, and an optional paper that you can do  in place of the final. Brantingham sets his students up for success and encourages them to come to office hours."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Selected Topics in Social Anthropology,ANTHRO 149,A,"10/10 would recommend Professor Brantingham. He is the best professor I have had at UCLA, thus far. His lectures are meaningful and everything is very straight forward. The material is interesting and he relates it to our lives which makes understanding the course concepts so much easier. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CLASS FOR ANY MAJOR!!!  His tests were easy as long as you actually paid attention in class and cared to understand his main points."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Selected Topics in Regional Cultures,ANTHRO 169,A+,"Professor Brantingham is a gem. Please take him. I trust you his class is not difficult. I toke him online for spring 2021, and his class structure is lectures (which are 3 lectures a week, they're very fun and engaging he adds movie clips or other videos), followed by weekly readings and bi-weekly quizzes. (Quizzes are based on lecture and readings but its open note).There is an optional final and research paper but if you do good in all your 4 quizzes you don't have to take the optional final exam or research paper. He also does weekly raffles to win gift cards if you submit him an analysis of the weeks lecture and how it realtes to songs he uploads. Please take him this class is an easy elective or major class and you will sincerely enjoy your time with him. 10/10"
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Selected Topics in Regional Cultures,ANTHRO 169,A,"I took the Anthropology of Crime. It was extremely interesting. The lectures were great. He combined slides, lecture, movie clips, graphs and backed up the information with a lot of data, much of it surprising. The lectures were recorded. There were several options for grading, and you could choose the one that gave you the highest grade. There were either 4 quizzes worth 25% each, or you could substitute a research paper for 2 of the quizzes, or the final exam for 2 of the quizzes. Because the material is so interesting, and he is a great lecturer, learning the material isn't hard - as he holds your interest the entire time and his methods cause you to remember the facts. He is a great professor - I would highly recommend this class with this professor."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Selected Topics in Regional Cultures: Ecology of Crime,ANTHRO 169,A,"this class is impossible to fail. It is truly such an interest and engaging class. It was the only class I've taken at UCLA that I actually wanted to attend and paid attention the whole entire time. he shows clips from well known movies that shows theft or something that has to do with the lecture and plays a minimum of three songs before each class that you can email him about explaining how it has to do with what he's teaching in class that day and if he picks you then you get a free breakfast/lunch on him! I would highly recommend you take him up on that offer because it's a great way to get to know him. This was hands down my favorite class I have ever taken. TRULY TRULY recommend you take this class. I promise you there's almost no workload at all. you essentially can choose which assignments you want to do instead of doing them all. You can choose between taking 4 quizzes which are INCREDIBLY easy or say two quizzes and a paper, etc. say you aren't feeling like taking a quiz? well then you don't have to! and you can make it up elsewhere. it's so great."
P. Jeffrey Brantingham,NA,Selected Topics in Regional Cultures: Ecology of Crime,ANTHRO 169,A+,"ecology of crime. there is 100 points in the class and you can get those points in different ways. there are four 25 pt quizzes throughout the quarter, and 50 pt research paper on a prompt that he gives, and a 50 pt comprehensive final exam. you can do any combination of those assignments to get your points and he will use the highest point combination for your grade. it's a pretty chill and interesting class and it was fun speaking with him in office hours. the content isn't very difficult but you absolutely need the textbook, there is no escaping that."
Hans Barnard,NA,Science in Archaeology,ARCHEOL 30,A,"Easy A if you are ever looking for one.  Professor Barnard is an enthusiastic guy and but his lectures got a little boring towards the end of the quarter.  He finishes his lecture in about an hour (even though its supposed to be 2 hours).  I LOVED the first half of this class; we learned about mapping, and scientific technology that has larger implications rather than simply for ""finding things.""  I HATED the 2nd half of the material (boring and focused more about deplorable topics such as ""feminist archaeology"" and some crap).The workload is not too bad (we had to read three articles and a chapter of the textbook per week; but if the material is boring its torture) and the homework is just effort based (as in, you turn in something coherent and you get a 99% no matter what.  The quizzes are VERY SPECIFIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! for all that reading you get 12 questions (almost all of them analogous to this question about the Great Gatsby: ""What was the color of the car that Tom was driving on his way to..."").  You could honestly not do any reading and do just as well as another person who did ALL of the reading (kinda have to get lucky)."
Hans Barnard,NA,Science in Archaeology,ARCHEOL 30,A,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST GEs YOU COULD TAKE AT UCLA. IT WAS SO AWESOME AND SO EASY. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GET YOUR SCIENCE GE OUT OF THE WAY. THIS CLASS AND ARTS&ARC 10 ARE THE EASIEST GEs IN THE GAME. I also learned a lot about archeology in this class. All you need to do is the weekly online quizzes. There's no final or essay either. No midterm or attendance taken. This is an excellent course purely there for the sake of learning and having fun.
Hans Barnard,NA,Science in Archaeology,ARCHEOL 30,F,love professor barnard! he is funny and his suits are 10/10
Hans Barnard,NA,Science in Archaeology,ARCHEOL 30,A,"I really enjoyed this class and there is seriously no reason to do horribly in class. Professor Barnes is super passionate about his work and a lot of the course material is interesting and was a great introduction into archaeology for me. Grades are based on weekly assignments and quizzes. Assignments are fun and don't really take much time. Quizzes are based on readings and have very specific questions so good luck guessing if you didn't read it. Also, the ""final"" is basically a final quiz based on all the readings so make sure to study all the past quizzes!"
Hans Barnard,NA,Science in Archaeology,ARCHEOL 30,A,"TAKE THIS CLASS. It is the easiest A I have ever gotten. He does this thing where he prints our your names and calls on you during lecture so that you participate but they are really really easy questions and there is no pressure to answer correctly at all, sometimes they are just questions that ask your opinion. Discussion section is required...I had a TA that made sure you read every week by calling on you randomly during class but the reading is somewhat manageable. You have weekly quizzes online of 12 questions or something like that based on the readings and lecture. If you open his lecture slides and the readings while you are taking the quiz you have an entire hour to answer the questions so you have time to go look them up (I recommend using the ""find"" function on the readings).  For the final, you just have to answer the questions from the weekly quizzes, so I recommend writing down the right answers from your quizzes throughout the quarter. As an added bonus, prof. Barnard is actually pretty funny during lecture."
Hans Barnard,NA,Science in Archaeology,ARCHEOL 30,N/A,"Super sweet funny teacher.. the readings arent interesting, really. but the teacher makes the class fun and understands its a G.E"
Jared M Diamond,NA,World Regions: Concepts and Contemporary Issues,GEOG 6,A+,"This class was completely online for Winter quarter 2022, so this review may not reflect everyone's experience. I enjoyed this class a lot, though I'm not sure it met the high expectations that I had knowing the professor. While Jared Diamond was an interesting lecturer, the lectures did tend to drag on sometimes. Additionally, both lecture and discussion had participatory parts, where speaking was necessary. The workload was fairly easy: the only homework was 10 weekly 'mini-papers', which were about 500 words, centering on the weekly readings. While they took a bit of time to write, they were fairly straightforward and graded easily. Everyone also had to do a presentation for one of the 10 weeks, though this was fairly easy as well. The midterm and final were both two short essays (about 1-2 pages) regarding overarching themes from the course. They were very easy, though this may partially be due to the course being online. Otherwise, participation was also graded during the discussion sections. Overall, I'd recommend this course for anyone who wants a fairly easy GE with an engaging professor. Be prepared to participate in discussions and have some minor work on the side, however."
Jared M Diamond,NA,World Regions: Concepts and Contemporary Issues,GEOG 6,A,"Great class and great professor! Prof Diamond doesn't use slides but listening to his lectures is a treat. This class is really well-organized and stress-free. Each week there's some engaging readings (not too much) and a 1 page reflection on the reading, and the midterm and the final are both composed of two short take-home essays (1-2 pages each) encapsulating the main ideas of the course. Really simple and a very interesting class, and Prof Diamond is a really nice man and so approachable and knowledgeable. Can recommend!"
Jared M Diamond,NA,World Regions: Concepts and Contemporary Issues,GEOG 6,A,"By far my favorite class AND professor at UCLA. Prof. Diamond is extremely knowledgeable and friendly. GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS!!! He is such an interesting guy and it’s always a pleasure to chat with him. Took it during covid so everything was online, but the experience was amazing nonetheless. Readings for this class are really fun, participation matters."
Jared M Diamond,NA,World Regions: Concepts and Contemporary Issues,GEOG 6,N/A,"This was probably the most interesting class I have ever taken. Professor Diamond is really interesting to listen to and has so much knowledge about geography. He is clearly teaching the class because he enjoys it and for someone who is so famous in the academic world, he is incredibly approachable and easy to talk to during office hours.The class format was a bit strange, as discussion section was worth 1/3 of your grade and tests accounted for 1/6, which could be good or bad depending on the TA and whether you cope well with exams. Shout out to this quarter's TA, Jason, who was great.The exams were leniently timed essay exams with very broad prompts, and the grading was generous. Content-wise, the class is essentially based around Diamond's most famous book, ""Guns, Germs, and Steel""  and overviews geographic reasons why certain regions have been more successful than others.This class is overall really chill and interesting and I'd recommend it to anyone when it's offered."
Jared M Diamond,NA,World Regions: Concepts and Contemporary Issues,GEOG 6,A," EASILY one of the best classes at UCLA. Professor Diamond is a stud and one of the best geographers in the world, so it is in everyone's interest to take this class regardless of whether it's in your major. The class is basically a 10-week summary of his most famous theses and publications. Like in Guns Germs, and Steel, he explains why the world is the way it is based on geography. Each week of the class focuses on a different geographic region (the Americans, New Guinea, sub-Saharan Africa, etc.), and he does a deep dive into that regions biogeography, physical geography, history, culture, language etc. The lectures are 3 hours long without slides, which sounds daunting, bu the material is so interesting that you don't really notice."
Jared M Diamond,NA,World Regions: Concepts and Contemporary Issues,GEOG 6,A,"Take this class!!! This was possibly the most interesting class I've taken so far at UCLA. It basically explains why the world is what it is today due to geography. We learned a lot about the history of different places (a lot more history than I was expecting) and modern day topics too. There are quite a few readings, but they are manageable. You need to read them as there are weekly 'mini-papers' where you discuss and compare the readings in 300-500 words. The weekly lecture is long, slides are not used, and you definitely need to take notes. It is quite tiring and my hand usually hurt afterwards, but we got a couple of 10 minute breaks and it was only once a week. I found it very difficult to catch up on a lecture, even if you have someone else's notes, so I'd really recommend trying not to miss any. Discussion sections are student-led, so one week your group will have to prepare a presentation on the lectures and associated readings. The discussion sections are not the most interesting 2 hours, but as long as you answer/ask 2-3 questions per week you'll get 100 for participation. Overall, I recommend this class. Professor Diamond is a legend."
Jared M Diamond,NA,World Regions: Concepts and Contemporary Issues,GEOG 6,A+,"Jared Diamond is a genius and you should feel lucky to to go to an institution where he is a professor. His book, Guns, Germs, and Steel, is a Pulitzer Prize winner. He's really smart, go to his office hours he's so chill! In regards to the class, it's easy!!! Sure the papers once a week can be annoying but I found the papers to be pretty easy. For us, they were a 300 word minimum but I often wrote close to 1000 each week lol. You should focus on analyzing the text as it relates to current events or your daily life, don't focus on summarizing the texts. The exams were easy. I got 95% on both the midterm and final exams. It's just a lot of information and it's kind of annoying since 100% of the test material comes from his lectures. But if you have a friend and compare each other's notes you should be fine. He often gives you a lot more questions than you have to answer so it guarantees that you'll be able to answer some things lol. Overall phenomenal class, easy GE with a world-class professor! Highly recommend."
Jared M Diamond,NA,World Regions: Concepts and Contemporary Issues,GEOG 6,A,The class is definitely one of the better ones offered at UCLA. Make sure you go to Office Hours whenever you can because that's where you can actually get something different out of the course as Prof. Diamond has quite a few interesting stories to tell you about his work that don't normally come up in class. Pay attention during lecture and you won't actually have to study for the exams. You can usually just skim through the readings and get away with it. You won't regret taking the class.
Jared M Diamond,NA,World Regions: Concepts and Contemporary Issues,GEOG 6,A," Definitely an interesting class, and professor has great knowledge on the topics covered. He can literally answer every question any student throws at him!   However, it is important to note (that I feel other students haven't emphasized enough) is that this class actually has a lot of load.  First of all:*Lecture is 3 hours long.  Basically no power points.  This means that you have to take effective notes and pay attention for 3 hours long (albeit with two  5-10 min breaks  every hour so, and short slide shows)  *Discussion is 2 hours long, have to raise your hand and give a thoughtful response each week.  Also, there you have to present for around 1.5 hours once during the quarter on the topic of that week.*One Homework every week, around 2 pages double spaced.  There are actually 4-6 different reading that adds up to around 100 pages, and you must analyze all the article into one coherent essay.  Once you get used to it, its fine, but had difficulties at first.*A LOT to memorize for midterm/final.  Literally had 100 pages of notes purely from the lecture by the end of the quarter. Though there is a lot, honestly its manageable.  Had a great time.  However, since I took 4 classes, it was too time consuming for me.  At the end, got a solid A though.  Basically, if you put in the effort, you'll get an A!"
Jared M Diamond,NA,World Regions: Concepts and Contemporary Issues,GEOG 6,N/A,Jared Diamond is an amazing professor. His class is very interesting and engaging! Lecture is only once a week but it's a three hour lecture and a two hour discussion. Students can send it questions for the midterm and the final! He's very caring and cares what his students has to say. Even more impressive is that he takes note when students are talking to him and he really listens to you:) Take his class if you have a chance!
Jared M Diamond,NA,World Regions: Concepts and Contemporary Issues,GEOG 6,N/A,"He is definitely a master at his stuff. He knows what he is talking about. The only down side to this class is that he teaches verbally that's it. You better bring a laptop to type EVERYTHING he says. His tests are very fair because he has the class email questions and he just makes the test from what everyone emailed him :) He is a great professor, not to mention FAMOUS! lol. "
Jared M Diamond,NA,World Regions: Concepts and Contemporary Issues,GEOG 6,N/A,"Best class I have taken at UCLA! I had no idea who Professor Diamond is when I signed up for the class- just thought the material sounded interesting. It was the best decision I have ever made (among many bad classes choices I have made at UCLA).Lectures were super interesting, discussion was lively, and I learned so much from this course. Till this day, I still remember the concepts I learned in this class (very rare for many other UCLA classes). Recommend 100%!"
Jared M Diamond,NA,World Regions: Concepts and Contemporary Issues,GEOG 6,N/A,"He is one of the best professors I've had at UCLA and  this class is the most interesting, life-changing class I've taken. 3-hour lectures in the morning were difficult but TOTALLY worth it. You learn so much interesting information that completely broadens your view of the world. He always shows lots of pictures and tells us interesting random facts, making lecture fun. Excellent lecturer, very easy to follow. Even though it is intimidating that you have to apply to be in the class, it ended up being very easy for me. Without THAT much studying, I managed to get an A on the midterm, an A on the final, and an A in the class. Anyone & everyone should take this class with him!"
Jared M Diamond,NA,World Regions: Concepts and Contemporary Issues,GEOG 6,N/A,This was one of my favorite classes at UCLA!  Prof Diamond is an amazing professor!  He holds lecture once a week for 3 hours (which can be long at times) but he is able to speak eloquently and teaches you his theories in the most clear and interesting way possible.  Take this class if you are interested in the subject and you will not regret it!  Go to lecture and discussion and take good notes.  The readings are EASY and fast.  Midterm and final are not that difficult as long as you study and go to lecture. 
Jared M Diamond,NA,World Regions: Concepts and Contemporary Issues,GEOG 6,N/A," Professor Diamond chooses to only have one lecture a week rather than two, and as a result, every lecture is lengthy.  With that said, this class is completely reasonable in degree of difficulty.  The exams are nothing unexpected, and although discussion is mandatory, it's never boring.  On that note, Lilia is an amazing TA, and would be an interesting professor in her own right.  As for lectures, there were a total of ten, with each focusing on a different region of the world (and the first lecture serving as a general introduction).  The first lecture is the most fascinating and most coherent, because in it he presents the theory for which he is most famous.  In other words, the quality falls apart a little over the course of the semester, and things get slightly disorganized over the course of the quarter. However, it hardly matters how much sense Professor Diamond makes, because the sheer breadth of his professional experience and knowledge more than compensates.   Don't just listen to him; ASK QUESTIONS.  You'll never have another professor who is more dominant in his field and known for innovative theory.   Altogether, very reasonable, fairly easy to do well in.  Just attend and participate in all discussions, attend lecture (nobody tries to trick you in exams), and that's really it.  Diamond's most famous book, Guns, Germs, and Steel, is a great 'outside' resource or supplement to the course."
Jared M Diamond,NA,World Regions: Concepts and Contemporary Issues,GEOG 6,N/A,The man is a genius. He is worth taking because he knows what he's talking about and has teaching skills.
Jared M Diamond,NA,World Regions: Concepts and Contemporary Issues,GEOG 6,N/A,"I absolutely ADORE Professor Diamond! His class was sooo interesting! I dont think that i have ever learned so much interesting material in any class as i did in this one. His tests were fair and easy to study for. I highly reccomment Barbara Maida as a good TA. Her sections were so interesting. I loved this class so much that I was actually sad when it ended. This class is by no means an easy A, though. I didn't study for it too much and i ended up with a B. Even though i am normally a stickelr for grades, my grade didnt bother me because i learned so much. Take this class!! Diamond is famous and won the Pulitzer Prize! This class will definitely change how you look at the world."
Jared M Diamond,NA,Fiat Lux Freshman Seminars,PHYSIOL 19,N/A," Course taken: Geography 6 Geography 6 is a cool class for a nonmajor, but as a geographer I found it pretty dull. Diamond pretty much just preaches at you and there is no critical thinking involved in the class whatsoever. Section was completely irrelevant to lecture--it was based on massive (like 75+ pages/week) readings that we were NEVER tested on. Annoying. Easy midterm, option to write a paper instead of the final. Kind of a joke, but a boring one. "
Jared M Diamond,NA,Past Societies and Their Lessons for Our Own Future,ANTHRO M148,A-,"Love Diamond. He is sweet and kind and has a plethora of knowledge. But honestly this class is a joke. Everything he talks about is really based on personal experience and subjective knowledge. His lectures are very interesting, but honestly the discussions were where I learned the most. Very cool class to take my first quarter at UCLA, but did I learn anything? Meh, not really. Easy A tbh, barely studied or did any work. Just take him because he's a celebrity and has amazing tweed coats."
Jared M Diamond,NA,Past Societies and Their Lessons for Our Own Future,HNRS M152,A,"Taking a class with Diamond is cool because he's obviously famous. The content is decently interesting and discussion sections are engaging. The class is an extremely easy A, to the point that I thought it was kind of a shame because you don't get pushed to really learn anything. Just kind of a cool place to have a few interesting conversations and see a legend close up."
Jared M Diamond,NA,Past Societies and Their Lessons for Our Own Future,GEOG M153,A+," I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to have Jared Diamond as a professor. Though he does read off of his notes and rarely pauses, this is not much of a problem is you can write fast - which I could, handwritten, with few problems. He adds anecdotes in his lectures, which changes the routine flow with humor and random facts . Before he goes into the week's select country, he asks if anyone in the class has ever visited that country, and proceeds to engage in conversation with them about it. He also leaves lots of time at the end of his lecture for questions, and also has office hours weekly.  However, this class would not have been as amazing as it was without his TA, Ali Hamdan, which supplemented the course with great in-depth and multi-perspective readings and discussions facilitated by his sarcastic humor and brilliant mind. He made this class my best academic experience here at UCLA. Participation is 40%, so you better talk and perform well on the weekly reflection papers. Midterm and final exams are easy because the students submit their own questions, so if yours are good, you could bet that many of them would show up on the exam. You also did not have to answer all of the questions on the test - there would be 40 MC, for example, and you'd only have to answer 30/35. Pretty fair. 10/10."
Jared M Diamond,NA,Past Societies and Their Lessons for Our Own Future,GEOG M153,A-," This class is structured exactly the same way as Geography 6. Honestly just go to Geography 6 and look at the reviews there. Professor Diamond is a celebrity after all with lots of wisdom and respect surrounding him, which motivates you to go to class more. He is a great lecturer albeit his soft voice and rather monotone fluctuation.  I took Geo6 before I took this class. The material is pretty interesting but it can't compare to Geography 6. Maybe I'm comparatively more disappointed with this class just because Geography 6 was so great. It's like a sequel to a great book and it just doesn't feel the same anymore. The class sort of feels like an extended discussion of the issues he spoke about in Geography 6 but applied to case studies, that is a different country each session to talk about. It gives you insight into how different countries dealt with crises in their history and common patterns on how they coped with those crises. Basically, it's about learning from past countries' mistakes with the implications of applying them to our world today. It's an interesting class, though discussion can be kind of a bore (my TA was pretty boring and made discussion literally a 2 hour discussion which was a nightmare). The class is pretty easy as long as you pay attention in class and know the material; what Jared says in lecture is literally the material you learn for the tests so be sure to take good notes."
Maureen E Mahon,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"Professor Mahon is great in Anthro 9. Her lectures were interesting as well as thought provoking. She elaborates on her own field research as well, which I found to be quite insightful since it relates directly to the class. The readings were informative and enjoyable. The class is not hard since there is only 1 mid-term, two minor projects, and a take home final. Overall, it was a positive experience."
Maureen E Mahon,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"Professor Mahon is a great lecturer. To me, she was hip and very lively with her lectures. The books we had to read were very interesting. The class overall teaches you about different cultures and just a way of living. I have learned so much from this class. I know I will use my new knowledge in the future for just life, in general. Take Mahon, she's good."
Maureen E Mahon,NA,Study of Culture,ANTHRO 130,N/A,"Professor Mahon is a very good lecturer and interested in student learning and opinion. She has a different take on cultural Anthro and is really knowledgeable. Her exams are take-home and relatively easy. I recommend her class, esp. to Anthro majors."
Maureen E Mahon,NA,Afro-American Experience in U.S.,ANTHRO M144Q,N/A,"This class was a breath of fresh air! It was so nice to be taught by someone who is passionate about the material and truly cares about her students.  I actually looked forward to coming to her class, which NEVER happens in my other classes.  There was a lot of reading, but the TAKE-HOME papers were based on all of it, so it was worth the time.  Prof. Mahon is incredibly approachable and leads great discussions in class instead of just lecturing.  I would recommend her to anyone, even if you're not an anthro major (which i'm not) because you will learn things about life, not just what is in the textbooks."
Terisa Green,NA,Theory in Anthropological Archaeology,ANTHRO 111,N/A,I took Prof Green's Archaelogy of California.  It was a very good class.  There is alot of info and you need to be able to write fast to take all of it down.  She grades fairly and cares about the students.
Terisa Green,NA,California Archaeology,ANTHRO 113Q,N/A,"Terisa is the best anthro professor I've had so far.  Her lectures are interesting and well structured, and she grades VERY quickly and fairly.  Terisa is da bomb!"
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"This class had lots of interesting material which made the lectures and discussions pretty engaging. If you watch the lectures, pay attention, and do the readings, you will be able to get every question right on the two tests which make up 60% of the grade. He makes sure that every question on them is taught in class, so it's a really fair test. The rest of the course is fairly graded as well, from the essays to the discussion section participation and attendance. There is no extra credit offered. Professor Alim is a really nice guy and cool dude."
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"I took this class online and almost dropped it when I saw the syllabus. It looks like its going to be a ridiculous amount of work but it turns out that you really do not need to do all the readings. He basically goes over all of the important stuff from the readings during the lectures, so the workload is not bad at all. You write 2 essays that are less than 2 pages each and you take a midterm and a final. You also do a weekly submission to your TA that's only a paragraph long. I still did the readings because they are interesting and help with the submission but don't panic if you can't finish all of them (there are like 100 pages assigned a week). Alim is funny and pretty engaging and incredibly helpful with preparing for the exams."
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"I took this class first quarter of freshman year during COVID-19 distance learning. Professor Alim is super helpful and super nice, and all of his TA's seemed pretty chill and interactive with the work material. Alim is not very strict (except about certain essay due dates) and likes to maintain a friendly class environment. His passion for the subjects discussed is apparent and really improves the class atmosphere. The coursework is very interesting and analyzes/criticizes relations between White normativity and spoken language. Most of the readings were very interesting, there were only a few that I did not enjoy. Not a difficult class as long as you stay on top of the readings and work with your TA groups. Definitely my favorite class first quarter. (To my understanding, the professor for this class changes every once in a while so if you get a chance to take it with Professor Alim it's definitely worth it!)"
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"Professor Alim is one of my favorite professors. He is extremely helpful, passionate, and want all his students to do really well. The exams were all asynchronous and online on Canva, and the 2 essays were quite easy. The workload is very manageable, because there is only 1 discussion post every week. The readings are very option (I barely did them) and still did very well on the test because he summarizes the readings during the lectures. I would highly recommend this class with Alim."
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"This was a really great class, he did it asynchronously during my quarter (as a commuter I loved this). I would recommend attending lectures at the very least, as he goes over all the material that will be on the tests and they are not recorded. The reading is a bit heavy, but he says to do the reading after the lectures to know what to focus on. He explains everything that is on the test in great detail. However, be warned because some of the test questions are incredibly long and detailed. Make sure you know everything he has mentioned will be on the test. Honestly, if you attend lecture, take notes, and look up what he said you will need for the test you will get an A. The material is very eye opening, it discusses how language is used to discriminate minorities and how we can have better educational pedagogies to fix this."
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+," TLDR: I recommend this class if you're looking for an easy social analysis GE (or just looking for an interesting class to take) Class structure:• Asynchronous lectures (recorded zoom lectures from like 2020) -- bulk of material, helpful in understanding the weekly zoom meetings• Weekly readings -- imo very long, but not necessary if you watch the lectures• Weekly zoom meetings/OHs -- should attend because Prof Alim basically gives out the answers to the exams and papers; even though he records them, he doesn't post them for some reason• In-person discussions  -- mandatory Exams (60%):• 1 Midterm + 1 Final (called them ""celebrations of knowledge""), 30% each• Super, super easy MCQ exams. Pay attention to his lectures, and you will be completely fine getting at least a low A on each exam. I did the readings in the beginning, but tbh you can get away with not doing them at all. Discussion (20%):• Participation (10%), Attendance (10%)• Please attend your discussions because they are mandatory lol. However, they're not too bad, if not a little boring because it's basically content review. Prof Alim goes over the material already in zoom + recorded lectures• Participation includes appearing as if you're paying attention to class, as well as weekly 1-2-3 assignments, which are basically reflection on the readings. You can probably just skim each of them and write whatever as long as it's somewhat relevant and coherent. Papers (20%):• 2 papers, 10% each• 1-2 pages long, single-spaced, including citations• It honestly depends on your TA, but all of the readings and Alim guide you toward an answer, and you can kinda ramble as long as you have a point. This is probably the hardest part of the course, but they're honestly not too bad either.• It's worth noting that because of the TA strike this quarter, the second paper was optional, so you got extra credit if you wrote it. Normally, he doesn't give extra credit."
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"Very easy class. The readings will look intimidating at first (something like 100 pages a week) but they aren't actually necessary to do well on the tests, that said they can be pretty interesting. The midterm and final are very easy because he reviews all the material on them if you just go to the sessions you will do fine, the essays are also graded generously (usually). Overall it was a very interesting class, it goes over some interesting social issues and ideas. A good choice for a GE.2 - 2 page single space essays, bibliography included in page count2 - 2 multiple choice midterm/ finals 25 question each"
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+," Great class; I think everyone looking for a no-fuss GE should absolutely take Anthro 4 with Alim. I'll start with my one (small) complaint: when I enrolled in the class, there was no indication that lectures would be online and asynchronous. I was a bit disappointed to learn this after the fact, but Alim's lectures proved to be quite interesting and engaging regardless of the fact that they were pre-recorded. However, I do think that in an in-person lecture setting, Alim's great teaching and amazing passion for the subject would be even more inspiring, so I have to say it's somewhat regrettable that we never got to be taught by him in person. Aside from this, Alim does a great job of preparing his students for his exams (he calls them Celebrations of Knowledge""). The tests are online and not proctored, and extremely doable if you review with the study guides/notes that others in the class will make. The only other grades are participation in discussions, which includes a weekly discussion post that is pretty much only graded for completion, and two short (~2 page) essays that were each due a week after the two exams. The first essay did not require any of your own research; you only needed to cite papers that had previously been assigned as weekly readings. For us, Alim decided to make the second essay extra credit, which was likely in part due to the TA strike. I'm sure grading of the essays varied slightly between TA's, but my TA graded very fairly: it seemed like as long as you followed the requirements and showed a decent understanding of the readings, you got full points. The grading structure was 10% for each essay, 10% for participation (5% for discussion attendance and 5% for weekly posts), and 35% for each exam. As far as the content of the course, it has a pretty big focus on African American language, especially in hip hop culture, as that seems to be the subject of the majority of Alim's work. Readings are assigned from other linguistic anthropologists as well as from his own papers and two of his books. The books are considered required texts for the course, but I was able to find a PDF of one and was honestly completely fine without ever purchasing the other. If you have any particular interest in old-school hip hop, I would encourage you even more strongly to take this class with Alim; he has to be one of the more prolific researchers in that niche. The content of the readings can be quite wordy and may require re-reading paragraphs to try and understand them, but I found it not to matter much because Alim's lectures did a great job of highlighting the main points in a much more comprehensible way. Overall, I found the class to be extremely manageable but still stimulating and engaging. I definitely came out of the class with a slightly more informed perspective on the world, despite it not being too challenging at all."
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"When I took this course, it was online, which made it relatively easier. It consisted of 10 online modules you would have to work through over 10 weeks. There were attached readings to the online lectures. The course is heavy in readings, however, a majority of them are quite interesting, and if you at least skim all of them, you will be 100% fine. Make sure you stay on track of the readings, as it just makes the midterm (online) and final (online) easier to work through. Additionally, there are 2 one-page papers where you have to apply the vocab into it (very easy). There are discussion sections, where your TA will go over the readings, so if you don't understand anything in the readings, it is usually explained in these sections. The lectures are prerecorded, however, he does hold one-hour live zoom sessions (not required to attend) that are EXTREMELY useful. He discusses exactly what will be on the online tests on the zoom call, so you know exactly what to study for.  You can really tell that he wants his students to learn and will make you succeed in the class. I highly recommend this class if you want a light GE overall!!"
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"I loved ANTHRO 4 so much!!! Professor Alim was super funny and engaging during his interactive zoom lectures and was always transparent on exam content, basically handing out As. I thought his exams, or celebrations of knowledge as he calls it, were fairly easy and a high or even perfect score is very attainable as long as you have a decent grasp of the readings. The readings were a little rough at the beginning of the course just because they were pretty theoretical and dense but they're genuinely interesting and you just need to understand the basic ideas. The workload was just the readings and one short weekly writing assignment for section, as well as 2 short papers that you were given at least 4 weeks to write. Overall a fun, easy, and insightful class, take ANTHRO 4 with Alim if you can!"
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,F," First off, Prof. Alim is absolutely wonderful. He is so passionate about his work and super encouraging towards his students. I am taking this class as a 1st year English major, and this class is not hard at all. The lectures are recorded, so you just watch them on your own time, do the readings for the week and go to your discussion. Some week's readings are heavier than others, but overall it is manageable. Also, from Alim's lectures, you can see which readings you actually need to do. Alim also hosts a Live Session Zoom each Thursday where he goes over the week's materials and hint at what will be on the ""celebrations."" The ""celebrations"" are your exams; you have one in Week 5 and another one in Week 10. Theses celebrations are multiple-choice and easy. If you do your readings, lectures and attend his Thursday zooms, these two exams will be a piece of cake.  Besides the exams, you have two short papers. Both papers are 1-2 pages (single spaced) and that is including your works cited. The prompts are very straightforward.  If you take this class, just read, watch/go to lectures, attend his Thursday Live Sessions and you will be on your way to an A.  Overall I really like this class, and Alim is amazing. His Zooms on Thursdays are things I look forward too. He always shares what snacks he has during the zoom and even showed us his dogs.  Take this class!!"
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"This was my favorite class as a freshman during fall quarter! All the TAs and the Professor wants you to succeed. The reading can be overwhelming, but as others said, you honestly don't need to read them. Almost all of them were really interesting though, and I enjoyed reading them when I wanted to understand the week's materials better. The two tests (both multiple choice) are EXTREMELY easy if you just show up to the weekly online review sessions and take a few notes down. Professor Alim is very clear in what he puts on the test, so you should not struggle at all. Because of the TA strikes, the 2nd essay out of 2 essays expected of us was not required and was turned into extra credit, but expect to do both if the quarter goes normally. They are really short and also decently easy. I would totally recommend this GE to everyone!"
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A,"The readings were unnecessarily long and complicated (almost 100 pages a week). I had to watch his lectures several times in order to understand the concepts, he is not very clear and usually just reads off his slides. I was able to get away with doing very few readings, but I am not sure how his exams will be structured in the future. The essays are interesting topics and depending on your TA not harshly graded."
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"I took this class as a pre-req for my comm major and loved it. Course material was super interesting, workload wasn't unmanageable, and professor Alim was awesome. There are a lot of readings assigned every week but I found that you could get away with only reading a few and watching the lectures (which were all online when I took the course). The tests were also EXTREMELY easy. if you understand what is going on in the class at all you should be able to get an A on both exams no problem."
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A," Took this class fall quarter of my freshman year and it exceeded my expectations! The course content was super interesting and Natalie was a great TA and I really enjoyed the discussion sections and she helped us prepare for the exams and papers.  The assignments consisted of: weekly readings and weekly reading responses, two exams (midterm and final), and two papers. The TAs and professors give you all the information you need to do good on the exams so if you pay attention you'll be fine. Do keep up with the reading because it is a lot at first and easy to fall behind. The readings seem overwhelming at first but you get used to it and the content is quite interesting.  **selling physical copies of Alim's books for the course!! email me at mariegodderis@g.ucla.edu**"
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"Pretty cool class. I personally thought the topic was sleep-worthy but I mean hey, a lot of it is pretty important to know and acknowledge. Alim himself is clearly very knowledgeable but its weird how uninvolved with the class he is. The tests are just on CCLE, the lectures are all previously recorded, and the textbooks are all written by him. Theres a good amount of reading but you can get by by just skimming and highlighting the key concepts (which are often just discussed in the lecture or in the discussion). Overall, easy A if you can manage to do well on the 2 papers. Would take it again, I liked how flexible the schedule was."
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"The class was pretty interesting, but the readings are very dense and there is quite a bit of it. If you end up having to skim, Professor Alim's lectures track the important info very closely. He focused on raciolinguistics a lot, since that's his area of study, but generally I did find myself thinking about language in new and useful ways. The exams are easy if you watch the lectures, and if you have a good TA the essay rubrics are clear. I'd take this class if you're truly interested in the topic and willing to work for it, but maybe not as GE."
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"Pros: The midterm and final are insanely easy. They are online and multiple choice, and the questions are not that hard. That said, disclaimer: I only found them easy because I went to the midterm review session (where he explains most of the questions in depth) and because I went to study sessions organized with the Groupme (for the final, there was no review session, but we were given a study guide, which helped out a lot). Definitely take advantage of the review session, and use the Groupme—this course can be difficult at times, but there will always be people who can explain the concepts in simpler terms, or can help answer questions. The two essay prompts were very easy, although that might depend on your TA. Getting an A in this class is not suuuuuper hard compared to some of the other GE courses. The professor is a fun dude, unfortunately lectures was asynchronous so the only time I got to know him were from the emails he sent and the study session. I didn't really go to office hours, but didn't feel the need to. Prof. Alim was incredibly helpful, and super knowledgeable—much of the material for this course comes from his own research and writing. Cons: The reading. Oh, the reading. To be honest, I did all of the readings, because I was scared of doing bad on the midterm and final. I felt that there were way too many, that they were way too long, and they were written in a terribly academic-languagey way (for people who think about language all the time, some of the authors' language style is so incomprehensible and inaccessible for the average college student. Or maybe that was just me). That said, you probably didn't really have to read through them all, nor do you have to read very carefully, because as I said a lot of it is covered by the review session. I would say that I found the discussion sections not very helpful, but that might just be my section. And finally, I had very little idea of what this class was going to be about, but I thought that the material would be about many different languages and ways of communication. This course focuses heavily on African American English, and a lot other styles are sort of shoehorned in and aren't relevant to the essays at all. That said, overall, the course definitely made me change the way I view language. Overall: If you don't like reading a lot, probably don't take this class. But if you are interested in the topic, and use the resources provided,  it shouldn't be too difficult. Just don't be a tryhard like me."
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"Alim is an excellent professor and you should definitely take this class if given the opportunity.  I took this class as a GE my first quarter at UCLA because I was interested in anthropology and wanted to learn more about it, and now, partially due to this class, I'm double majoring in anthro and bio.  Going into it, I was more expecting to learn about the science of linguistics and how language differs in different societies, but we focused a lot on the power of language and how it reinforces different ideas that people have about each other--which I didn't expect, but found very interesting and important to be aware about.  Expect to hear a lot of words like ""standard language ideology"" and ""cisheteropatriarchy.""  The course focuses a lot on Alim's research on Black Language in CA and Hip Hop in South Africa, and I would've liked to learn more about other cultures, but it was nice to learn about actual research he did.This class was pretty easy.  There are a few readings a week, a few very short papers throughout the course, and a two ""celebrations of learning"" aka exams that are timed multiple choice.  The exams are so easy, if you've skimmed the readings and paid some attention in lecture, you're all set.  Alim is very passionate about what he teaches, and his lectures are pretty clear.I found this class extremely interesting and I think it should be required for everyone.  It made me think critically about things I've never thought about before, and it inspired me to major in anthro (now a sophomore).  Take this class!"
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A,He is an amazing professor and fair on his grading. I also have the book so contact me if you need it- lesliearomanc@gmail.com
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"I took Anthro 4 virtually with Alim Fall 2020 and it was a super easy class. Although there were a lot of readings, the grade is dependent on just 2 mini-essays, a midterm multiple-choice tests, and a final multiple-choice test. Alim prepares you really well for both exams and gives a study guide and holds a review session. The class was completely asynchronous except for discussion sections once a week for 50 minutes. The slides had a lot of information but it was hepful that the lectures were recorded because you could pause it to take notes. I recommed taking this class with Alim, he is super helful, funny, and knowledgeable!"
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"I took this class in the first quarter of my first year (virtually), and I absolutely loved it. Professor Alim is a really great professor. It's usually hard for me to sit through lectures, but Prof. Alim is very engaging and makes learning the subject fun. This class really changed the way I think about language every day. I would definitely take this class again!Be ready for a lot of readings, but they're really interesting. Once you get familiar with the language they use, it's not very difficult to comprehend the readings. The exams come straight from the readings and lectures (especially his lectures), and the papers are short and easy to write if you pay attention."
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,Professor Alim is an absolute joy to learn from. He and his team of TAs are very well organized and are genuinely interested in teaching their students.
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"Alim's class was pretty enjoyable, and the grade consisted mostly of two papers and a midterm and final. My TA was Wilson, and he graded my papers very easily, and I was able to get As on both tests without much effort. Highly reccommend it."
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A," Selling Linguistic Anthropology textbook, text me at 510-861-1275 (great condition, bought used).  The class itself was pretty easy. While the readings are mandatory for discussion, you can often just skim them quickly for some key concepts to write down about in 3-2-1 assignments (3 concepts, 2 questions, 1 critique). The essays were fairly easy, being only 1-2 pages single spaced INCLUDING at least 4 references (you can start on them the same day they're due and still get an A or A+). Alim himself is interesting, keeping his lectures funny-ish with little jokes sometimes and his emails are very nice. The only thing that I didn't like was that the lecture slides were basically large bullet points with multiple sentences or a quote straight from a reading. Still, you can get an A on exams (""Celebrations"") by just carefully studying the lecture slides and examples he says."
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"I loved taking Anthro 4 with Alim!!! He is obviously an expert in the field who's passionate about what he does, and he's a professor who genuinely cares about his students, too. The workload is pretty heavy as there are many pages of readings every week, but I found them manageable if you don't pay attention to every minute detail. The midterm and final were not difficult at all as long as you paid attention to lectures (asynchronous during Covid) and don't skip important readings. The two short graded papers were also fairly easy to tackle and easy to score well on. I took this as a GE but actually thoroughly enjoyed studying anthro, and would definitely recommend Alim and Anthro4!!!"
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"I loved this class! It covers a broad range of topics but focuses on how language affects the social lives and identities of different cultures. I thought it was interesting, but it may not be if you are not an anthro/ling/comm major. The course is structured like this (COVID times): weekly asynchronous lectures, weekly readings, weekly discussion section, 1 midterm, 1 final, & 2 short papers. The lectures are engaging and short- there are usually 2 per week. This is where most of the information on the tests come from, so they are important! There is a lot of reading assigned each week but they are necessary to participate in discussion. Honestly you can get away with just skimming through and knowing the main concepts. The midterm and final were incredibly easy. I got 100 on the first & 96 on the second without really doing much. He explicitly tells you everything that will be on the tests beforehand so make sure to pay attention! I'm not sure what it's like during non-COVID times, but before the midterm he held a giant review sesh and for the final he gave us a study guide. The papers are short (1-2 pages single spaced), easy, and graded by your TAs. I got a 10/10 on both. Overall, this class was a super easy A but it also had cool content. We learned a lot about hip hop and how it influences peoples lives. Alim is a great guy and very accommodating. He is lighthearted, chill, and just a caring individual. I would 100% recommend this professor if you need to take Anthro 4. Even if not, it is an easy & engaging elective. As far as TAs go, I had Sara Castro and she was great. Take the class you won't regret it!"
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"TAKE THIS CLASS!! I have absolutely zero complaints about this class and Professor Alim. He is fantastic and if you have an opportunity to learn from him, take it. Regarding the structure of the class, there are a few readings necessary for each week and he goes over what you really need to know in his lectures. There are 2 ""tests"" which he calls celebrations (how cool right) and 2 short essays and participation which comprise of the final grade. The COOLEST part about Professor Alim is that he is at the forefront of his field and a lot of the readings we discuss are what he wrote! It's so cool and maybe a once in a lifetime opportunity. Absolutely no regrets, easy class, and the professor & TAs couldn't be better!"
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A,"Professor Alim is amazing and really cares about his students’ success. He provides so much guidance on the papers and exams and makes sure we all ace them. This class is really interesting overall and dives into the problems of mainstream “White english” in society. The only downside was how MANY readings we had to do every week. My TA required 3-2-1s to be submitted every week but they were optional for other TAs. As long as you get the gist of the readings, you’re fine for the exams. I think lectures give you the info you need to ace them. Very easy GE, 100% recommend."
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A," Selling Raciolinguistics and Linguistic Anthropology required texts (661) 339-8285 The class is pretty easy. There's 2 ""Celebrations of Knowledge"" which in every other class are usually called a midterm and final exam. They were multiple choice. Also, 2 papers which are 1-2 pages long and that INCLUDES the references. Finally, attendance in section and participation in section (both are 10% of your grade). Some TAs make you turn in 321s (3 main points, 2 questions, 1 criticism or comment about the readings) every week but my TA just had us talk about them in section during breakout rooms and then tell her what we talked about. Outside of that, there's is LOTS of reading. Expect around 100 pages a week. There's THREE required books but even then there is also PDFs uploaded to read as well. Yes, they are necessary to pass the class because you have to participate in section and the celebrations test you on specific terms and ideas in the readings. It's definitely doable though so don't get too discouraged. If you classes for a given quarter are reading heavy then maybe put this class off until later or put some other class off until later if you can. Alim himself is a GREAT teacher and very knowledgeable. A lot of the readings were written by himself and are his OWN research. The Raciolinguistics and Articulate While Black required texts are written or compiled by him and some others."
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A," selling textbooks 424-371-4691 Really easy class, prof was super chill, interesting readings."
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A," NOW CALLED ANTHRO 4!  I took this class with Professor H. Samy Alim. He seems like a great guy but this course was extremely disorganized. As a first year, it was very overwhelming to not know what was happening, and also for my TA to not know what was going on because of constant changes in the syllabus. Though I felt like I learned a lot about Black vernacular and ended up finding it interesting, I was not aware that this was what the class was about. ANTHRO 4 changes professors every quarter and going to the test bank to find exams is not helpful. I liked the energy in the class but it was constantly frustrating not knowing what was happening. There's quite a bit of readings and they are necessary to participate in discussions and for the exams. The exams were pretty easy if you attend lecture (since many of the questions are specific to lecture and not to readings). Overall this wasn't my favorite class because of its disorganization and me not knowing what the topic of the class was going to be. I did really like my TA Joelle! She's amazing!"
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,B+,"Professor Alim is truly a nice guy. He always came to class super happy, always in a good mood. But honestly, for a GE, the workload was pretty intense. Huge amounts of readings assigned every week. The midterm and final were easy, given that the final had a study guide, but originally our exams were not suppose to be like that. He changed it up because he really enjoyed the class. The effort for the readings were condensed because the TAs were super helpful. If Wesley Wilson is still a TA, definitely recommend taking him. Extra credit was provided, twice if I remember correctly and two essays were assigned. Alim's lectures could improve. His slides are were chunks of text and he doesn't upload. However, lectures can be fun because guests are brought in to present their research and they were always refreshing."
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"Anthropology 4 was a really interesting class content-wise. Professor Alim is also a very fun-loving professor, however, his slides can be an absolute nightmare to read. He literally copies chunks from the readings and places it onto the slides. Readings were informative and interesting, and the guest lecturers were truly the highlight of this course. His midterm and final were both multiple choice, and relatively easy, however, one must really put in the effort to study the material. This is because, both the midterm and final are very detail oriented based on the reading material. The ethnographic paper was also quite a lot of fun to do."
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A,This class is now called Anthro 4. Alim was a very knowledgeable and compassionate professor.  He really cared about engaging and teaching his students. He brought in tons of guest lecturers that were equally interesting. But the class material seemed repetitive to me. It focused raciolinguistics but the majority of the quarter was spent talking about African American vernacular and its effects and left out other racial groups. The tests were not difficult if you study for them and there was opportunity for extra credit. If you try at all you can get an A.
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A,"I feel that the below reviews are somewhat unfair.  This class is now called Anthro 4.Professor Alim is very passionate about raciolinguistics, and so, as is his prerogative, he made it the focus of his class.  He is very good about making us feel like colleagues, rather than lowly undergraduates, and makes an effort to keep it interesting.  He invites leaders in their fields to come speak to us, including Boots Riley, director of Sorry To Bother You, whose panel was extra credit.  His midterm was 25 multiple choice questions, which were pretty easy but if you get 3 wrong its already a B.  He changes slides super fast, which is kind of annoying, but the TA's were very helpful during discussion to clarify things.  There are a LOT of readings, but as an anthro major, i'm used to it.  Alim is at the forefront of the raciolinguistic field and I feel lucky to have been in his class."
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"Hmm, it's really surprising to me that some people write in such strongly negative reviews for Prof. Alim; ie ""avoid at all costs"".  I would recommend ignoring those reviews, as I had a really great experience with the class, and its hard for me to believe that people actually feel that way.  This class truly changed my perspective on the world in a really meaningful way, and I still think about things I learned in the class all the time. Alim is a really cool person who cares about student learning and making the class fun.  The lectures had lots of variety in media--ie youtube videos, films, etc.  This class was not easy, and doing the readings and going to lecture really was necessary, but if you work hard to understand the concepts and examples, you should do fine on the exams.  I definitely recommend this professor, and will try to take him again if he teaches another class in the future.  My grade: A+."
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"At first I was not a big fan of this class but as time progressed I started to enjoy it more. It seems overwhelming at first with all of the readings but I realized later that professor alim did not expect students to know every little detail. Nice teacher and nice TA's at least the guys, the girl TAs scared me a bit. Overall good class."
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"this was a great class! it focused on language inequality, which turned out to be a really interesting subject. a lot of assigned reading but you didnt have to do it all. if you go to lecture and skim the readings, you should be fine. alim is a really nice/cool guy who cares about the students. he's very open to talk to you during office hours, which you should talk advantage of for sure. pretty easy class and a lot of fun. "
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"This guys was an amazing professor. He is very concerned with a students grade. He also has lots of people come during the lecture within linguistic anthropology to get you interested in the field. There is lots of reading and hw to turn in every week. But you get attendance points.  He also gives you a paper to write about 6 pages this is just to help bring up your grade since they really dont focus on details as much.  The final was also an autobiographical essay.  He also gave us an extra 2%. He is really approachable and really helpful but you must go to lecture to do well in the class. If you got to lecture you will get a B and higher at the very least if not you will be lost in the class and the reading. But he its a fun class, so help fun during his celebrations of knowledge. "
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"Very repetitive. Way too much reading. Horribly done lectures in which he reads his slides verbatim. Ends up being a class about African American Vernacular instead of a general linguistic anthro class. Though, it is definitely very easy. Don't have to do the readings and can still get an A no problem. Honestly though, He could have taught us the concepts that it took him a quarter to teach in 2-3 weeks. Bad class that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. He's a cool guy and I like him a lot. I likely got an A in the class too. But seriously, avoid this class if you can. "
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"Prof tries too hard to be cool. Apart from that, there are too many reading assignments that are coupled with the stupidest assignments known to UCLA's campus: 3-2-1s, in which (for every single reading assignment) you must provide 3 important facts, 2 interesting facts, and 1 question. WTF? I thought I was done with this high school BS. If you are interested in taking a class alllllll about racial inequality in America, go for it. Otherwise, this class is boring and repetitive, with a long arduous midterm graded by obnoxious TAs. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. ever. "
H Samy Alim,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,Worst class ever and professor ever...the TAs suck too. Tons of reading and absolutely no guidance whatsoever. 
H Samy Alim,NA,Afro-American Sociolinguistics: Black English,AFRO-AM M166,N/A,Prof. Alim is fun to listen to and nice to look at!  This class was interesting and I learned more about myself than in any other course I have taken here at UCLA.  He is an extremely fair grader (as long as you show honest effort you pretty much get full credit).  He is very down-to-earth.

Jorja Leap,NA,Introduction to Social Welfare: Policies and Programs,SOC WLF 100A,N/A,"UCLA is home to some of the most entitled, ignorant young adults I have ever come across in my thirty years - - reading the reviews that they have written about Dr. Leap [previously Prover] has further solidified my opinion. I have worked in social welfare for the past ten years, and coming back to school has definitely been an eye opener. The Social Welfare department at UCLA is world renowned, and having met, studied under, and worked with Jorja for over a year, I understand exactly why this is the case. Jorja isn't about grades, she isn't about giving anyone a hard time, she isn't about pushing some liberal agenda - - she's been a social worker for over thirty years, and an educator for over twenty. Her insight and her down-to-earth approach to the field and the work that we do is entirely on point, and perhaps a bit too much for the students that take her undergraduate classes merely because they hear that they can obtain an easy A. Many of the students in this class are arrogant, and they don't care for the material. She gives extra credit opportunities via attending community events, and many students ask if they can leave early. She is intolerant of stupidity, and rightfully so. She expects people to show up, do the work, respect the amazing speakers she brings to talk to the class, respect other students, stay the hell off laptops and cell phones while class is in session, and learn something important about the community. Jorja has put her very life into her work, and anyone with a semblance of intelligence and maturity would realize the sheer magnitude of the life-changing educational experience that you receive under her tutelage. You can teach twenty-somethings a plethora of knowledge, but it is very obvious that you can't teach them to give a shit. UCLA is lucky to have Jorja on faculty, and I am truly blessed to have had my life touched by this woman. I love her, I respect her, and I am so incredibly grateful that I can be guided by a woman that has selflessly given to the community and has accomplished so much in her lifetime."

Jorja Leap,NA,Social Welfare in Multicultural Society,SOC WLF 101,N/A,"Really, people? I'm appalled at the comments below. Jorja Leap is hands down, an excellent professor. She has informative guest speakers to engage the class because she knows how stressful UCLA is, and so she successfully makes her class enjoyable. I took 100A and 101 with her and received A's in both. The readings are awesome and they provide great insight. I definitely recommend her classes, and if you can try to get Casey as your T.A. She rocks!"
Jorja Leap,NA,Social Welfare in Multicultural Society,SOC WLF 101,N/A,"super easy A and interesting class--I learned a lot. She's very funny and entertaining in the classroom when she's standing up in front of everyone, but she's not a very nice person at all it seems. She was very rude to me when I approached her outside of the classroom, and like many other people have said, she's condescending for no reason whatsoever. Take the class but don't try to approach her outside of it. She's a bitch and she knows it. "
Jorja Leap,NA,Social Welfare Organizations and Community Systems,SOC WLF 102,A,"I have literally no clue how she doesn't have a perfect rating. Easy and interesting class. If you can get in, you have to take it."
Jorja Leap,NA,Social Welfare Organizations and Community Systems,SOC WLF 102,N/A," Professor Leap is one of the greatest professors I have encountered at UCLA. Beyond the fact that she is brilliant, her life lessons as well as the information you learn in her classes will last a lifetime. She doesn't throw a bunch of material at you and expect you to memorize it and then regurgitate it on a final exam, but she provokes students' feelings and emotion, making a lasting impression on every student in her class.  If you cannot handle or are easily made uncomfortable by vulgarity, then stay away from her classes. But in my opinion, it is refreshing to have a Professor using language that is as harsh and fitting as the severity of the things she is talking about. She seems tough when speaking to the class as a whole, but when you approach her during break or office hours she is very sweet. Her book, which is a requirement of the class, is INCREDIBLE. I actually enjoyed reading for once. It is such an incredible, detailed and well written novel that explores her own personal struggles as well as her experiences on the street with gang members or ""homies"" as she calls them.  Another refreshing thing about Professor Leap is that her so called ""research"" is not numbers or statistics. She has real life interactions and interviews or ""life stories"" with gang members and records their personal history.  GRADES: She herself thinks grades are bullshit. Leap prefers that you actually learn something in her class, which is why she lures students in with the promise of an A, and then makes it VERY easy to obtain the A. The only thing is that you must attend every lecture and stay the entirety of the class. Which is actually enjoyable considering you watch eye-opening documentaries or have a ""homie"" come visit during lecture and speak about their life which will bring you to tears listening to. TAKE HER. She's THE greatest professor and I do not have enough good things to say. All of the idiots on here that say she's terrible do not know what they're talking about. They are probably just extremely sensitive to a ""bad word"" every once in awhile and need to understand that they attend a public university and are no longer in the eighth grade."
Jorja Leap,NA,"People, Organizations, and Systems",PUB AFF 114,A," This class is one giant non sequitur: there is zero continuity and no clear topic, purpose, or even a general theme. Topics discussed include jail, sexual abuse, spatial income inequality, covid, STDs in minority gay men, all tied together by Professor Leap wasting hours (yes) talking about her own family, personal anecdotes, experiences totally extraneous to class, etc. The entirety of this courses’ material could be condensed into a 2 hour period. That is not an exaggeration.  Prior to this class, I thought “I’d be ok with taking anything that gave me an easy A”.  This class proved me wrong. It feels offensive, unbecoming of UCLA, and like a huge waste of everyone’s time. It feels like you in on some kind of inside joke with Leap where you both know that if the administration found out she was “teaching” this course she would get in trouble. I’ve never really thought “my tuition is going towards THIS?” until this class (really, and I swear am not a snobby person).  Leap’s frequent attempts at humor go beyond edgy and are totally inappropriate: insinuating that all American veterans “died for nothing” (which yes, elicited laughs in this class) is a totally careless statement and would be wildly offensive to anyone who has lost a loved one in the military.  Anyway, I know leap has a large cult of personality here (and this class is easy — like mind-numbingly easy) but I’d discourage people from taking this course. Contrary to popular belief, there are quite a few easy A courses at UCLA, the vast majority are taught by professionals who you’ll actually learn something from. Leap herself is a renowned expert on crime and gang culture — it’s too bad she puts so little effort into this class."
Jorja Leap,NA,"People, Organizations, and Systems",PUB AFF 114,A," This class is WHACK. Dr. Leap is WHACK. The students, however, are also WHACK. Read to the bottom to hear the story. Dr. Leap has a philosophy: don't worry about grades. Do the work, get an A. Super helpful, should create a very generous and happy student population, and a very free-flowing and efficient lecture period, right? WRONG. She still would spend 10+ minutes every lecture talking about course logistics. Section material was not integrated with course material well. The guest lectures were never integrated. Books were not integrated until the final. Some of the lectures/guest speakers were super interesting. But they didn't have slides or handouts, so we had to take notes if we wanted to reference a stat or something. Three reflection papers and a final. Four required books (must be referenced in some papers and the final to keep you accountable). The highlight of the course was being forced to read these books. Just Mercy is required and it is incredible.  Story time:Dr. Leap invites the Deputy Chief of the LAPD for Community Engagement to speak with us. This is a  black woman. This is a black woman cop who supports defunding the police, spending more on community safety, etc., and she says so in her guest lecture. She is obviously not as left-leaning as the UCLA Pub Aff population, but jesus christ she is about as liberal as cops come. She is my ideal Deputy Chief of the LAPD for Community Engagement because she supports defunding the police!But when I say that these students ripped her apart in the GroupMe, it's an understatement. ""copaganda"" ""racist bullshit"" ""this is traumatic"" like jesus christ can you just listen to someone that has been working on the ground, in the field, etc. before judging? She has lived the experiences of black women in LA, she knows what cops deal with, why shouldn't we listen to what she has to say? Anyway, rant over.  Take the class for the books and the easy A."
Jorja Leap,NA,"People, Organizations, and Systems",PUB AFF 114,A+,I loved everything about this class. Professor Leap was outstanding and her lectures were very engaging and did not bore you. The ta's were very good as well and helpful. Participation does matter because they take attendance by giving you a slip in the middle of the class to turn in at the end of class. The midterm was easy and as long as you read the books and pay attention in lecture then you should get an A+ on that midterm easily. The final was a take-home essay and that was very easy as well as long as you took good notes throughout the quarter and read the books as well. The guest speakers who came throughout the quarter were amazing as well and made the class more interesting. I would recommend taking this class because it is chill and an easy A for sure.
Jorja Leap,NA,"People, Organizations, and Systems",PUB AFF 114,A," This class was the highlight of my winter quarter. Professor leap assigned four books to read over the course of the quarter, and they were very impactful. For grades, you have to do two reflection papers and a final policy brief. The reflection papers are easy if you read the books, as you're just providing your own opinion and connecting it to class. The policy brief is a little more strenuous and was due the Friday before finals week, so keep that in mind.  Leap proclaims herself that this is an ""Easy A"" class. If you participate, it feels more like a discussion than a lecture. The TAs are all great, and we had the pleasure of hearing about their studies in their graduate work. If you are a Pub Aff major/minor, this is a class that will stick with you years after graduation."
Jorja Leap,NA,"People, Organizations, and Systems",PUB AFF 114,A,"I loved this class. I would sooooo take another class with Professor Leap but I am a sociology major so I don't think it would be towards any credit unfortunately. This professor has awesome stories, guest lecturers, engaging lectures, and interesting experiences. In this class Professor Leap emphasizes that it is about knowledge learned so READ the books as they're interesting, do not stress over the papers, and work on your final project in a timely fashion and you'll get an A. Don't ask her about your grade in class and definitely don't ask her a question she JUST answered. I really wish this class were in person but it was conveniently online as it was a class that ended at 8pm and in the Winter quarter it would get dark earlier. I know I didn't get to talk to her personally enough but I'd say if you have the chance to do it. You can come to her to talk about anything (when it's outside of class) and please participate and ask questions/make comments because it makes the class all the more entertaining."
Jorja Leap,NA,"People, Organizations, and Systems",PUB AFF 114,A,"For this class we met every Monday on Zoom and had 4 books to read, 2 reflection papers, 1 final project. She wanted us to work in groups for the final project and if we did, we got extra credit but you could work solo if you wanted to. You could choose the topic to do your policy brief on and had to do a video component. The books and class material is so interesting! She's super funny, caring, inspiring and understanding. We had guest lecturers and she let students voice their opinions and ask questions. We had TA sections and my TA was a bit serious. TA sections were a bit unnecessary to me and kind of awkward. One day she had us watch The Simpsons for the last 30 minutes of class and she created a safe space for students to share personal stories that related to the material. She's known for having this class be an ""easy A"", but you still need to put in effort! I highly recommend her!!"
Jorja Leap,NA,"People, Organizations, and Systems",PUB AFF 114,A,"super easy class, everyone gets an A but the lectures were all over the place and she lost my attention once she started putting out copaganda, there was a lot of cognitive dissonance tbh. all the books are pretty interesting reads (i actually recommend everyone read caste: the origins of our discontents it was that good) but not necessary to the class"
Jorja Leap,NA,"People, Organizations, and Systems",PUB AFF 114,A,"Please keep in mind I took this class during the COVID-19 pandemic, so everything was virtual. Professor Leap is awesome. She cares about her students so much and she truly is focused on student learning and does not grade harshly at all. Grade is based off of just three 2-paged, personal reflections and a final that is two 3-paged essays and one 1-page essay based off of prompts she gives. As long as you pull from the readings and/or lectures and put some effort and thought into your essays, you will get an A in this class. There are 4 books assigned and they are all really good and easy to finish quickly because of how intriguing they are. There was a guest lecturer almost every week of the second half of the quarter, which I was not a huge fan of because Professor barely lectured. I understand she wanted her students to hear from other people and from different perspectives, but I think there were one-too-many guest lecturers."
Jorja Leap,NA,"People, Organizations, and Systems",PUB AFF 114,A,"Jorja Leap is INCREDIBLE! Take this class! Jorja does not care about grades, she cares only about student learning. I learned so much in this class and overall, the class was extremely informational, applicable, and really opened my eyes to prevalent issues. All the guest speakers were very interesting and all of the assignments, minus the final, are reflections on things we learn in class and the books. She does assign us to read some books (which are all very interesting). As long as you have a basic idea of what happens in the books, you should be just fine for this class. The final is worth 50% of the grade and was graded more harshly than the reflection assignments. You get the final prompts on a Monday and the final is due on a Friday. Make sure that your final is extremely descriptive and reflects the books accurately. You want to make sure you answer ""hows"" and ""whys"" in your final to make sure its as thorough as possible. Jorja DOES NOT give A+'s, so the highest grade you can get in this class is an A."
Jorja Leap,NA,"People, Organizations, and Systems",PUB AFF 114,A,"This was the worst Public Affairs class I've taken. It is extremely disorganized and the lectures were a waste of time. The assignments were easy but the teaching staff gave no instructions and little feedback. Dr. Leap emphasizes that she cares more about student learning than grades, but it creates a stressful environment for students who are balancing too many things, especially a global pandemic. Reflection papers would be assigned after class ended at 7PM and then due the next morning, giving students only a few hours to work on the paper. The turnaround time for grading was so slow and we wouldn't get feedback on the first reflection paper until the second one was already turned in. The lectures were horribly disorganized and there was no central theme throughout the course, not to mention one of the lectures was completely devoted to copaganda and ""all lives matter"" rhetoric."
Jorja Leap,NA,"People, Organizations, and Systems",PUB AFF 114,F,"Amazing professor, amazing class. I can’t imagine not taking this class before graduating UCLA. Dr. Jorja Leap is an angel. Her expertise in public affairs and other related fields is outstanding. I looked forward to Mondays because of this class. She has phenomenal speakers, fabulous TA’s, and wonderful assigned books to read. Dr. Leap’s lectures always amazed me and I will never forget what I have learned. This was such a great experience because of all the interesting material presented to us. I recommend this course 100%"
Jorja Leap,NA,"People, Organizations, and Systems",PUB AFF 114,A,"Please take her if you want a stress relief class. Her lectures and class itself are just like therapy sessions. We get into serious topics, but you learn so much. She doesn't do tests or midterms. We just do 3 reaction papers (2 pages each) and 1 final which is 3 questions around 8 pages. Honestly it's an easy A, she even says it herself. I had Mike as a TA, he's so sweet and plays music for us. The class also requires us to do 4 readings, the readings along with the lectures are for the reaction papers, and final they help us relate what we read to the lecture. The reading may be a lot but their easy reads and you're fine skimming too. Please take her and take any courses she offers! Guaranteed an A grade."
Jorja Leap,NA,"People, Organizations, and Systems",PUB AFF 114,A, You MUST read the assigned books.  Tests are easy as long as you have read.  The books are critical to your success on the written portion of the essays. VERY engaging class.  Professor Leap has structured this in such a way that provides wonderful insight to students about many social issues
Jorja Leap,NA,"People, Organizations, and Systems",PUB AFF 114,A,"Really great class overall. Half the lectures are given by the TA's . Professor Leap is so engaging and speaks about relevant and meaningful topics such as poverty, mass incarceration, gangs, and immigration. Definitely read the books because they are tested on despite not being covered thoroughly in class. No homework aside from reading and lecture attendance is mandatory."
Jorja Leap,NA,"People, Organizations, and Systems",PUB AFF 114,A," This is probably one of the easiest classes on UCLA's campus, and one of the most interesting. Dr. Leap is an incredible lady and it was really an honor being in her class. There is no homework for this class, and your grade depends on a midterm and take home final, which are based on the readings, lectures, and TA lectures (the TAs lecture on their dissertation topics). As long as you take notes, pay attention in class, and do the readings, you will likely get an A. In regards to the lectures, I don't think I've ever been more engaged with any class or professors. Dr. Leap has brought me to tears several times in her class, and I feel like I'm a better student and person because of it! Highly recommend this class to any pubaff major/minor, or anyone just looking for upper division credit!"
Jorja Leap,NA,"People, Organizations, and Systems",PUB AFF 114,A,Professor Leap is the best professor anyone could ever ask for. Her lectures are incredibly engaging and she gives so many examples it's almost impossible to leave class without learning something. There is only a midterm and final which are also really easy IF you have done the readings which involved 3 books; all of which were fairly interesting. She is however incredibly strict in regards to the use of technology. If you are caught she will drop your final grade by entire letter. Professor Leap is phenomenal though so if you get the chance you should take this class. It is the easiest A ever!
Jorja Leap,NA,"People, Organizations, and Systems",PUB AFF 114,A,"Jorja Leap is a really engaging professor. She lectures at a comfortable speed for you to take notes and highlights what will be on the exams. Her lectures are engaging in a sense where you will not feel bored or tired while listening to her. She is very very strict on technology, so don't use it in class unless you want to be publicly shamed for doing so. She prioritizes students to learn the material rather than worry about grades, so her midterm and final exams are very easy as long as you do the four main readings (which are all, for the most part, pretty good but long) and study the lectures. I would highly recommend this professor to anyone!"
Jorja Leap,NA,"People, Organizations, and Systems",PUB AFF 114,A,"Professor Leap was a very nice professor. She has engaging lectures that cover a wide range of topics and she is not very tough on classwork. There was one midterm that did require knowledge of the readings, and one take home final paper that is a lot easier if you do the readings, but still possible to complete if you haven't as long as you know someone who has. She has a very strict policy regarding cell phones, laptops, etc. in class they are just straight up off limits. She also grades attendance strictly but you can show up 20 mins late"
Jorja Leap,NA,Internship Seminars: Social Welfare,SOC WLF 194,N/A,I never took her class but knew her well when I was a student at ucla in 2004-2005.  She asked me two times to help her with her evaluations at the end of term..and to pull out any negative comments before submitting them to the department. 
Rosalie Edmonds,NA,Language Development and Socialization,PSYCH M149,F,"hot and cold. sometimes you feel like you know what you're doing, other times you have no clue."
Rosalie Edmonds,NA,Language Development and Socialization,PSYCH M149,N/A,"Prof. Edmonds is super nice and compassionate in regards to COVID and any personal situations you may have. She and her TAs are very generous regarding extensions. There is a lot of reading for this class. There is a required book by William O'Grady called How Children Learn Language, which I'm selling (408)-881-2503. This is just the beginning of many, many articles and papers you will have to read additionally. The grading is based on 3 10 point quizzes and 3 written assignments on readings. I attended all the lectures and did all the readings and got 60 or 65/65 on the assignments. Section is mandatory but you get 2 free misses and can skip section and instead complete a reading prompt each week. She's a nice professor and it's an interesting class from a more anthropological perspective (since its also cross listed as Anthro 152) but it is a lot of work IF you do everything properly and care about your grades. She also offers a make up quiz at the end of the quarter."
Rosalie Edmonds,NA,Language Development and Socialization,ANTHRO M152P,A,"The lectures and lecture slides were straight to the point. Everything you need to know for assignments/quizzes is in the lecture or readings. There are no surprises!We had 3 quizzes and 3 assignments. In final's week, we had an optional make-up quiz that would replace your lowest quiz score and it was entirely questions from previous quizzes.The quizzes have about 10 questions of true/false or multiple choice. Sometimes they are worded tricky but if you put some thought into it you'll realize it wasn't very tricky at all. The assignments were mini essay questions. Each had a different amount of questions on relevant topics at the time. Usually, it was 2-3 questions of multiple parts. Students have the opportunity to go to office hours with a draft and ask ""is this ok? what should I do?"" so it isn't difficult to do well on the assignments.Attendance was not required in lecture but it was in discussion. We did have 2 free sections that we could miss without penalty, but we also could submit a reading response to our TA as alternate credit instead of showing up. Sections were really helpful tho, so I'd say if you can go, go.She offered extra credit for course evals. If 60% of the class completed them, we'd get an extra .5 points; 70% is an extra 1 point; and 90% was an extra 1.5 points. We got about 74% completion so we all got an extra point. It doesn't seem like much but there aren't much places to get points, so it is worth. She is extremely caring and understanding of the current situation. She made discussion optional during inauguration week, that type of understanding. They offered extensions for those who had good reason. I personally got 2 extensions and my TA and prof were very understanding about my situations."
Stephen B Acabado,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A+,"This was a pretty easy GE. It could be somewhat interesting on certain days. To be honest, just study the study guides he gives. The difficult portion of this class was the essay, but TAs are generally able to help you with any aspects of it."
Stephen B Acabado,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A+,"This class wasn't even a backup class for me when I was registering during orientation this fall, but somehow I signed up and it was the best decision I could have made for my continuously sinking GPA. Tests are the same as the study guide, labs take place during discussion which is basically free points, and the essay is 5 pages and not hard. Acabado forever."
Stephen B Acabado,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,A,"Although this class was a relatively easy A, I kind of dreaded going to lectures and discussion sections. Professor Acabado takes attendance using an app called TopHat, which you have to pay for, and he also uses the app to display his lecture slides. The app crashed often, which was annoying and affected checking in for attendance sometimes. There are weekly quizzes on CCLE, but they are all take-home and online so it should be a guaranteed 100% on each. There are three labs done in discussion, and they are also very easy A's. The midterm and final were very similar to the study guides that Acabado gave out for each of them.As a lecturer, he tends to be *very* boring, and I'd find myself zoning out often. Honestly, lecture isn't too important other than checking in for attendance.This was an easy GE class for me, but it was just kind of a hassle because I had to try really hard to be somewhat interested in the lecture material."
Stephen B Acabado,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,A+,"This class was a relatively easy GE. Weekly online quizzes are very simple, since they are not timed, and each one can be attempted twice (the first attempt will tell you what the correct answers are).  Discussions are mandatory graded on participation and completed lab worksheets-- we worked in groups and the worksheets were generally graded very leniently. The midterm and final were very fair-- Prof Acabado uploads a study guide for each , and pulls directly from the study guide questions for the actual midterm and final. Both exams also include one or two short essay questions, which can be easily answered if you attend lecture, or do the readings. I would recommend filling out the study guide with another person in the class, or going to Prof Acabado's office hours (some of the quizlet answers are incorrect). There was also a 4-6 page paper due between the midterm and the final (around week 9 for us). The five prompts were uploaded very early on in the quarter, from which you would choose one. The prompts had very clear topics/questions/instructions, as long as all the requirements were met,  you got a decent score.  I'd recommend showing the TA a rough draft during office hours. All in all, the class was very straightforward and manageable, even if you aren't interested in archaeology/anthropology."
Stephen B Acabado,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,A+," This class includes:Weekly discussion section 20%Paper 1 10%Moodle Quizzes 5%Mid-term 25%Paper 2 15%Final 25% I got an A+ in the class. Make sure to go to discussion and talk; you'll get major points and it's an easy 20% of your entire grade. The papers were pretty easy, just semi-eloquently answer the questions provided with correct grammar. The midterm and final were cake if you completed the study guides and memorized them. A majority of the multiple choice come from the moodle quizzes, so make sure to do the quizzes. The quizzes were easy too because (1) you could redo the quiz up to 3 times and only the highest grade would count and (2) after the first try, the answers are provided, so you're basically guaranteed 100% if you try. The work does add up, but it's definitely doable. I took 2 other classes and worked over 20 hours a week.Acabado's lectures are dry and unnecessary, but I went to every lecture anyway, so it may have impacted how well I did. He posts up all the slides, but isn't a good lecturer because he's unorganized and rushes through the topics."
Stephen B Acabado,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,A+,"If you are looking for an easy GE to fulfill your Foundations of Society and Culture category, look no further. Professor Acabado is a prompt and kind teacher who is very interested in archaeology, particularly passionate about his own research. Even though his powerpoint lectures could be boring, he posted everything on ccle for students to refer to. You don't really have to do the readings from the textbooks, unless your TA is strict about what topics to cover in his/her discussion. I mainly used the textbook a few days before the midterm and final. The easiest part about the class was that Professor Acabado gave study guides for the midterm and final which essentially told exactly what was on the tests. There were no surprises whatsoever. The final was also non-cumulative (an added plus). He even gave extra credit questions on the final which were quite frankly unnecessary since the class was already so easy.  The class had two essays which were both manageable and on relatively interesting topics. Overall would highly recommend this class to anyone."
Stephen B Acabado,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A," Anthropology 8 is really a typical ge course.Pros: u don't have to even look at the textbook. u don't have to go to class. u can even cheat if u dare. Exams will be easy if you prepare using the study guide. Taking notes may be useful, but quite irrelevant most of times. Papers take some time, but overall it's easy to get an A. Cons: this is boring for people who only want to take a GE. He talks a lot about Philippines and few care to learn. Sometimes he himself is not concerned."
Jeanne E Arnold,NA,California Archaeology,ANTHRO 113Q,N/A," Professor Arnold is a great lady. You can tell that she really cares about her students and about her work. However, she is one of the most monotonous lecturers I have ever listened to.  Luckily, over half of her class is taught by guest lecturers- those who were experts on the topics we were discussing. This really saved the class, and helped people to remain focused on the presentations. Her grading is based on a midterm, a paper (she gives lots of choices for paper topics), and a final. I thought that her midterm was fairly difficult- and I have a 3.96 at UCLA. I got a B- on the midterm. However, I got an A+ on the paper, and I knew what to expect for the final. You can basically predict the essay topics based on overlaps significantly with the powerpoints and readings.  The midterm and final were both a combination of MC and short essay/ answer. I thought that the questions on the midterm were a lot more specific and tricky than those on the final. In the end I got an A in her class. Although it hasn't been my favorite class at UCLA, I thought California Archaeology was very interesting as a person who has lived in California my entire life. Overall, its a good class. The lecturers can be boring- same with the reading (but there isn't a lot), but overall its doable. "
Jananie Kalyanaraman,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A,Pretty easy class. Did not do reading at all but professors go through them in class so it was not a problem. Midterms are timed essays. I skipped final bc I did well in midterms and received a good grade. Class has interesting but serious content.
Jananie Kalyanaraman,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A,"It was entirely asynchronous when I took it in Fall 2021. The lectures were clear but not very engaging. The contents we discussed in the class and the readings were interesting and I liked them. There were only 2 papers, one midterm, and one final. There was no discussion post required during the week, so this class was relatively light in terms of workload. She made the final optional (which I was so thankful for that). The papers were not so hard, but the second one you need to conduct ethnographic feildwork which was cool and I learned a lot from it. However, I feel like I had good experiences in this class not because of the lecture but because I got a very good and caring TA. She is the best TA I had in that quarter. The discussion session was awesome mainly because of my TA. Therefore, I would recommend this class. It is an easy GE, and hope you get a good TA like what I had."
Brooke A Scelza,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A,"Anthro 1 was an amazing class. I was so interested in the human relation to primates and the history surrounding our evolution. It was fun to learn the subject and I can honestly say it's one of the best classes I've ever taken at UCLA. The lectures are easy to understand and the tests are based more on the lectures than the book. The tests are multiple choice and short answer but a couple of days studying the slides should allow you to answer every question confidently. I must say I did enjoy reading the book, though. The best part is that an 84% and up is an A! Good luck and have fun, my friends. Also, go to office hours, Professor Scelza is cool and engaging."
Brooke A Scelza,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A,"Anthro 7 (aka Anthro 1) is an amazing, interesting GE that is made even better when taught by this professor! Pros:1. The class is graded on roughly an 85 and tests are relatively whatever was covered on slides (I just looked over my class notes and I was fine)2. The information is really, truly interesting and you get an introductory, practical explanation of evolution and its effects3. Scelza is an amazing lecturer and makes sure that the material is clear and concise; there's no beating around the bush for this oneCons:1. Weekly inquisitives (homework quizzes)2. You'll have to memorize a lot of weird ape names and characterizations for the second unit. Nevertheless, this is an excellent GE made even better by this awesome professor."
Brooke A Scelza,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A," I loved this woman from the first day I sat in her class. She really does remind you of a character from the show Bones. I would definitely recommended taking her. She does incorporate her research into her lectures, but it does pertain to the material!  Course Breakdown:Midterm 40%Final 50%Discussion 10% Getting a good grade:First off most of her exams are lecture based. Study her slides and memorize the examples as well. The TA's are really anal about definitions so memorize the definitions that pop up in her lecture from the book. The book is a good supplement and not really dense at all if you actually do the assigned reading ever week. The final is cumulative, but draws heavily from the second half of the course. Memorize the homework questions and answers from your discussion! Some of those pop up on the midterm and final Personal Experience:I got B+ on her exam and a A+ on her final, I ended up with an A+ in the class. I would have gotten at least a solid A on the midterm had the TA's not been anal about the definitions. When they say write only one or two sentences. Write a paragraph with two periods lol. Use examples from the lecture and discussions to get the full credit. Oh, and try to get Kate Brunson as your TA she is really funny and willing to help all the timeTake the class with Scelza if you are interested at all in Anthro! And it is an easy GE for life science."
Brooke A Scelza,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Midterm is OK, but final is short but pretty hard. I ended with a C+ but definitely learned a lot because all I did is just memorized all the lecture slides. Bottom line, go ahead to take this class if you don't mind memorize shit load of material just like scerri's chem class!!!!"
Brooke A Scelza,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Professor Scleza is a great professor. She gives you all the materials you need to succeed. Her powerpoints are very thorough which really help to understand the information. She also puts them online so you can download before class. Her tests are not as hard as she makes you think. You'll still have to study quite a bit, but she is one of those professors that wants you to succeed. She is a great lecturer and I highly recommend her."
Brooke A Scelza,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Wow, I'm surprised that no one had evaluated Dr. Scelza despite how many people take her class. Pointlessness aside, Scelza is an AWESOME Professor, she is incredibly organized. Class is done powerpoint style, but she places emphasis on printing out slides and writing what she says - Slides can be memorized. She's really cool, looks and sounds like Daisy from the hit TV Show Bones, and she definitely knows what she is talking about. She makes tests sound ALOT harder than they are, so if you're like me, you'll study like crazy, just to finish the midterm in 25 mins. with a Huge smile on your face - I don't mind, I learned ALOT. Bottom Line: Scelza is a great teacher who teaches a fun GE - Take the Class and Learn Something from a GE for a change =)"
Brooke A Scelza,NA,Human Behavioral Ecology,ANTHRO 124P,N/A," I have to disagree with most of the reviews here. I found Professor Scelza's lectures entirely uninspiring. While she does put a lot of information into her slides there are a number of problems with her lectures.  First, the module I took (Human Behavioral Ecology) involved quite a number of fairly abstract quantitative models for explaining human behaviour. However, as these were presented on an extremely broad scale: they were made assumptions about hunter gatherer societies in general - it became quite difficult to conceive of how they actually manifested in the real world (HG societies being hugely varied and not complying with extremely basic statistical models). Had she introduced a concept - e.g. methods of hunting in a particular society, and then demonstrated how a particular model could be applied to that situation, I would have stayed engaged with the class. As it was, she would simply talk in an extremely abstract fashion rarely displaying any applicability to the models in question.  The fact that a good 90% of lectures involved Professor Scelza simply reading out slides, the dull nature of the content kind of inspires you to stay at home. I think the fact that only around a quarter of enrolled students were ever in a lecture at any one time is testament to the level of engagement felt overall.  So, if like me, you do well writing papers - i.e. understanding concepts and demonstrating that knowledge by expanding on the basic points from lectures, you will hate this module - there is no continuous assessment. If however, you enjoy learning content and then repeating it parrot fashion in multiple choice exams then go right ahead, just prepare yourself for some dull hours in the lecture theatre."
Brooke A Scelza,NA,Selected Topics in Biological Anthropology,ANTHRO 129,A+," So backstory, I actually didn't mean to sign up for this class, I thought I had signed up for another ANTHRO 129 class which was supposed to be genes and diseases so I was literally like ""what the heck"" when the professor said, ""Welcome to the anthro of evolutionary parenting!"".  However, I decided to just continue on with the class because it fit my schedule better than the class I initially wanted to take and honestly was quite shocked to find out how much I enjoyed the class!! So basically, there's no midterm and final. The grades largely depend on 7 quizzes (7-8 questions) that are usually held on Thursdays and then a chunk of your grade comes from a life history interview which you'd have to interview someone about their life history from how many kids they have to how the arrangements were when they were growing up (anyone above 45 should work) and then write a 3 page summary from what you've learned based on the material you learned in class. For the final, it was done in the format of an unessay, so you could literally do things like a comic, a brochure, boardgame, magazine etc about something you found interesting in class and the write a one page summary about your project arguing why it was an important addition and to who.  There are 3 books that are assigned for the class readings and I read everything up to week 5 and basically gave up because she only asked like 1 question from it and it was the title lmao. So honestly you don't need it but it is good general knowledge to have if you're feeling diligent! :)  Section is mandatory but also didn't require much effort, just show up for 50 minutes and you're good.  Lectures are not podcasted but they were engaging enough to keep me from wandering off every few minutes but honestly just read through the slides the night before the class and have a general understanding of what she's trying to get across and you're fine.  I ended up with a 99% in the class, only got 1 question wrong out of all 7 quizzes and scored full points for my unessay & life history stuff.  Overall, very easy upper div that isn't boring, highly recommend you take this!"
Brooke A Scelza,NA,Selected Topics in Biological Anthropology,ANTHRO 129,B,"I didn't show up to two discussions and half-assed all the readings, discussions, and assignments and still managed a B. I went to class, paid attention, and got B-range on the exams. Her exams are fair and direct. You aren't expected to know anything beyond what she goes over in class, and even her slides are pretty clear. You can manage to not go to class and do okay, but I think going to class enriches your knowledge of the material since she goes over it well and gives examples. She does spend a fair amount of time talking about her research, which isn't even tested on (rarely was), but the material she teaches is actually interesting and useful. I recommend her class and her as a professor. She's welcoming, polite and passionate about her work."
Brooke A Scelza,NA,Selected Topics in Biological Anthropology,ANTHRO 129,A,"Literally such an easy upper div if you just need upper div units. There's one midterm, one final, one argument paper, and 2 article reviews that you do in discussion that are dummy easy. There's no readings except for two articles that you pick and the material is exactly super interesting. Both my TA and the professor were really nice and easygoing though, so idk maybe that's why I never once shed a tear from this class. You just need to go to lecture and pay attention and take notes, the concepts are interesting and not hard. I'd take a class with Scelza any day she's cool and the classes are well structured, also the exams are multiple choice mostly with like 3 one-paragraph short answers, true/false, and fill-in-the-blanks."
Brooke A Scelza,NA,"Selected Topics in Biological Anthropology: Mother Nature, Father Time: Evolutionary Perspectives on Parenting",ANTHRO 129,A+," Dr. Scleza was an incredible professor who did very well even without a TA (though she absolutely deserved a couple). Her lectures were packed with information and she was very clear and accessible in the way that she presented. She left out superfluous topics, jargon, and information in order to clarify and emphasize the course topics, but she was not unwilling to delve further when prompted. She is very clearly knowledgable and passionate about her research, her work, and this class. This was one of my favorite classes I have ever taken. She gave us 4 quizzes and dropped the lowest grade. The quizzes were very 10 multiple choice questions and were very easy if you just pay attention in lecture. Her slides are quite hefty and definitely need her translation, especially for the case studies, so try to make it to class. If you can't it would be helpful to attend office hours just to gain clarity on some slides. She is super helpful and approachable. There was a final paper, but it was easy and fun!"
Brooke A Scelza,NA,"Selected Topics in Biological Anthropology: Mother Nature, Father Time: Evolutionary Perspectives on Parenting",ANTHRO 129,A+,My favorite class of the quarter! Really interesting and easy. There were no big exams and only small easy quizzes every thursday that just check that you've done the bare minimum. The unessay project at the end of the quarter replaces the final and is also a lot of fun. Overall a 10/10 class
Purnima Mankekar,NA,Asian American Women,ASIA AM 50,A+,"This class was super easy and super interesting at the same time. Dr. Mankekar is an engaging and phenomenal lecturer - extremely experienced and knowledgable in her field. Even if you are not interested in Asian American studies, take this course if you need an easy G.E. I can't guarantee that you will not become interested within a few classes, though! Seriously, take this GE. I learned a lot about intersectionality and race and gender relations and will use this knowledge for the rest of my life. All you are graded on is two short reports and a group presentation (graded by your TA). I attended the lectures for the first few weeks and then stopped around the middle of the quarter and I was still able to get A's on the reports and presentation. Keep in mind I am a STEM major - writing is not my strength. The final is optional. I was basically done after week 7. This class is the ideal GE - easy, but not boring at all!"
Purnima Mankekar,NA,Asian American Women,ASIA AM 50,A+," This class will be the easiest class you will ever take. I took it as a first year and I put in the bare minimum and got an A+. You do not need to go to lectures although the professor was lovely.  The class consists of 2 short reports, a group project and an OPTIONAL FINAL. No one took the final. I got full points on both reports without reading any of the materials for the course. The group project is just you and your group leading one of the discussions. If you take this class, pick Gabby as your TA. She is absolutely wonderful and is the most understanding being ever.  Overall, this class is so easy it's impossible to not get an A."
Purnima Mankekar,NA,Asian American Women,ASIA AM 50,C-," Professor Mankekar seems like a pretty nice person, but I don't think her lectures were that clear. She often didn't elaborate on topics or when she did it did not help my understanding. I didn't watch many of the lectures or readings though, unless they'd help me with the two papers and 1 group discussion presentation.  I got a C- because I didn't turn in one of the papers, but I'd take this class if you plan on doing all your assignments because it was really interesting and pretty easy if you did the work. She also made the final optional because COVID causes difficult times, which was super kind of her, but I feel that kinda backfired on me because it made me unmotivated to learn the material. She also gave 2% extra credit if you did the course evaluation at the end of the quarter. Overall, you should take this class if you want to learn about cool ethnic studies concepts like intersectionality, gender being a relational concept, and transnationalism."
Purnima Mankekar,NA,Asian American Women,ASIA AM 50,A+,All you are graded on are two essays. There is extra credit for the professor reviews.
Purnima Mankekar,NA,Asian American Women,ASIA AM 50,A+,"This was a great GE to take, it was genuinely interesting and super easy.  The professor was super accommodating and friendly, and the TAs were also very helpful."
Purnima Mankekar,NA,Asian American Women,ASIA AM 50,A+,"Don't even need to watch lectures, I just skimmed over readings every now and then, half the time I didnt even read them. We have 2 essays and a group project, for these, I would recommend watching the assigned group projects and lectures to complete the assignments. Easy class, I would take it again for sure. Essays are only 3-4 pages and easy to write."
Purnima Mankekar,NA,Asian American Women,ASIA AM 50,A+,"This class was mainly taught by the T.A. I did not watch any of the lectures at all and was able to get a very good grade in the class. The class is mainly composed of two essays and a group project. Due to COVID, the exam is optional if you are content with your grade."
Purnima Mankekar,NA,Asian American Women,ASIA AM 50,A+," Great class! I especially love when professors provide documentaries and films for students to watch, and the ones we watched in this class were some of the most interesting ones I have seen. Joseph Tsuboi, my TA, was really kind, knowledgable, and accommodating. They made my experience in the class awesome!"
Purnima Mankekar,NA,Asian American Women,ASIA AM 50,F,"I am currently taking this class and I love it! It's asynchronous, so we can work at our own pace. The group presentation of discussion questions was feasible and not difficult in comparison to other classes. The essays seem hard at first, but after you become comfortable using gender as an analytic, it becomes easier! Overall a great class and easy GE!"
Purnima Mankekar,NA,Asian American Women,ASIA AM 50,A+," I loved this class. Professor Mankekar is so sweet. She was very clear about the fact that she wanted this class to be low-stress and was super accommodating. She made the final optional! My TA Jananie was also really sweet and a good grader. I took this class in the online format and really the only work to submit was three papers, each around 4-5 pages and spaced 2 weeks apart, responding to a prompt on the course content and synthesizing materials from lectures, readings, and films. They each took me quite a long time but they are not very difficult; I got an A on all of them. There's asynch lectures to watch, readings (often long but close reading isn't crucial), and a few films. You also have to show up to discussion and participate as a part of your grade. One thing to be aware of before taking this class is that it's not simply about the history of Asian American women. It's more about ""using gender as an analytic"" and has a lot do with understanding and analyzing how things like race, gender, labor, and geopolitics shaped the lives of Asian immigrant women. That kind of sociological/analytical/whatever type stuff did not come naturally to me so it took a bit of BSing at first. Definitely something to keep in mind if that's not you. However, I still liked the class regardless; it really opened my eyes! If you are looking for an easy GE/diversity req, it's a great option."
Purnima Mankekar,NA,Asian American Women,ASIA AM 50,A-,"She was very accommodating, the only thing that you had to attend was discussion sections. Even then, they were really chill especially with the TA Hannah. Overall the class can get pretty boring and the workload in the first half can be a lot, but it makes sense considering it fulfills two GE requirements. I would def suggest taking this class if u need the 2 GE requirements, especially because the final was optional for us. The class was structured to look at other women in history as well, not only Asian American women. However, I found this much more interesting and engaging. Its a good class and a good accommodating professor, but not an easy A. You work for it with the 3 papers that take quite a bit to finish (like 3-5 days) and your group presentation (which was very easy) and possibly your final"
Purnima Mankekar,NA,Asian American Women,ASIA AM 50,F,She made our final OPTIONAL. Bless her soul.
Purnima Mankekar,NA,Asian American Women,ASIA AM 50,A-,"This class opened my eyes to a lot of issues regarding the Asian American experience. For that, I would take this class again. The readings are pretty heavy some weeks, but it's doable if you don't have another reading-heavy class. The two essays took quite a while to write and it was hard to synthesize ideas from different modules into just 4-5 pages. If you do the readings, it's a lot easier to complete the essays. Participation is required in discussion and encouraged in lecture. Make sure you attend the discussion, but if you can't make lecture, the professor Bruincasts. Overall, I understand why this class fulfills the diversity requirement because it doesn't just tackle the Asian American woman's experience, but also the experience of other minorities, genders, and classes."
Purnima Mankekar,NA,Asian American Women,ASIA AM 50,B," I went into class expecting to learn specifically about Asian American women and looking to relate my experience to the class but I definitely didn't get what I was expecting to learn.  I wanted to learn about specific Asian American women or solely about Asian American women but this course was a lot broader. I was pretty disappointed by how this course was structured. This class focuses a lot more on using ""gender as an analytic"". It ties the struggles that Asian American women face(d) onto a broader level by relating / comparing it to the struggles of other women of other ethnic communities.  I was pretty confused as to how everything in we learned related and connected together. The course material kind of went all over the place. The readings were pretty long and not too interesting. The professor was pretty unclear when teaching and tended to use a lot of big words that didn't need to be used. The way that she described certain topics often  overcomplicate them. My TA was also pretty bad at communicating and breaking down lecture materials during discussion to better explain everything. I scheduled an appointment with her once and she was talking to another student so I waited for 30 minutes. And then when they finished, she was like ""Oh no, I'm so sorry I completely forgot. I have ______ now and I have to go."" So I didn't get to discuss my ideas for a paper with her. (And I ended up doing badly on the paper).  If you do the readings and go to lecture, you should be fine. Do well on your papers.  Readings are what's mostly on the finals + details or main ideas from the films you need to watch."
Purnima Mankekar,NA,Asian American Women,ASIA AM 50,A,"The subject material isn't exactly what I had hoped for, as you don't learn specifically about Asian American women or specific women. Instead, you examine the Asian American communities using ""gender as an analytic."" I was upset for a bit about this, but honestly it was still an interesting and engaging course. The professor is a bit intimidating but overall very nice. She bruincasts her lectures, and she is extremely thorough in her explanations. The tests were multiple choice, which made it extremely easy, and the essays were also easily done if you read and understood the readings."
Purnima Mankekar,NA,Asian American Women,ASIA AM 50,A-,"If you're looking for your ""easy"" GE, then this is it. You don't even have to show up to class. Just listen to the podcasts. She's not an amazing lecturer so I would go to TA office hours for extra help. For the readings, I never found it necessary to do them. In discussion, they would be analyzed by groups so just go to discussion sections and take notes then, and you will be fine in regards to them. Mankekar also touches up on the important parts in class so don't worry about them. Overall, Mankekar wants you to do well, so the class is never made hard. Both midterm exam are all multiple choice, so just memorize the concepts with flashcards the night before and you will do well. Only time you actually have to understand some info is for the small papers you write, which even then are not a big deal. Podcasts + discussion is all you need."
Purnima Mankekar,NA,Asian American Women,ASIA AM 50,A-,"this class made me woke ! the material was interesting and engaging, and i definitely took a lot away from this class for my own life. mankekar covered a lot in lecture so it was hard to follow because her powerpoint slides barely had any text on them. the assigned readings were a lot, so be prepared for a lot of reading (or a lot of BSing). there were two assigned papers which were both graded harsher than i expected (but this depends on your TA). would recommend if you're really interested in the content!!"
Purnima Mankekar,NA,Asian American Women,ASIA AM 50,N/A,"The professor was very engaging and enlightening during lecture. However, I wish she would have sent the power points before lecture so students could pay closer attention to the information she was saying that wasn't on the slides. She tended to have lots to cover over one lecture and went through the information too quickly at times. The course itself was interesting, but the amount and length of readings assigned was difficult to manage. The class also has a multiple choice midterm and final on top of the two papers assigned."
Purnima Mankekar,NA,Asian American Women,ASIA AM 50,F,"I took this class because I was interested in engaging more in my cultural roots and saw the amazing reviews on BruinWalk. The reviews (when I checked) neglected to mention the heavy amount of reading required for this class. While I agree that Professor Mankekar is a great professor who is passionate about helping students learn and keeping them engaged, it is difficult to keep up with such long and often repetitive readings. We have yet to take the final, but the midterm was 30 MC questions. Although MC exams are usually easy, the specificity of the questions and the short length of the exam made it difficult to do well."
Purnima Mankekar,NA,Asian American Women,ASIA AM 50,N/A,"Really fun class, opens your eyes to a lot of things! No textbooks required, just do the online readings carefully and listen to podcasted lectures."
Purnima Mankekar,NA,Asian American Women,ASIA AM 50,A-,"LOVED this class! Very interesting material that covered a lot of different aspects of the subject. Professor Mankekar knows how to keep things interesting and challenge her students to think beyond what we are normally taught to think. The readings were not bad at all, and discussion sections really helped to clarify the ideas. Lectures were interesting, as were the videos shown in class. My TA, Derek, was AWESOME. Highly recommend him! Exams were a breeze and Professor Mankekar and the TAs prepared the students very well. I would definitely take this class again, and I urge everyone else to take it too!"
Purnima Mankekar,NA,Asian American Women,ASIA AM 50,N/A,Professor Mankekar is one of the best professor I have had a UCLA. She is so passionate about the class and she truly cares about her students. I recommend taking a class with her. The class was fair and ranged from a variety of topics!
Purnima Mankekar,NA,Globalization: Contemporary Issues,GLBL ST 100B,A-," Professor Mankekar genuinely cares about her students. She's one of my favorite professor, so much that I make a point to look up classes taught by her just because I liker her so much! The lectures are podcasted and she usually posts the slides, but honestly going to class you get a fuller experience and can laugh along to her jokes. The midterm and final are really inclusive of the lectures and readings, so make sure you skim them or just pay attention in lecture/discussion.  The class (and most of her classes) are broken down grading as so:10% - class and discussion participation30% - reading responses (theres two so 15% each)30% - in-class midterm (multiple choice)30% - in-class final (multiple choice)"
Purnima Mankekar,NA,"Sex, Race, and Difference in Transnational Film",FILM TV M124,A+,"Mankekar is one of the best professors I have had at UCLA so far. She is an engaging lecturer who genuinely cares about her students' learning. The topics covered were incredibly interesting and applicable to many facets of our lives today. The movies were great and some of them are now on my all-time favorites list. There are no mandatory screenings so you are able to watch them on your own, and the reading assignments were never overwhelming. Her lectures were a lot more complex and advanced than what we were expected to know for the film analyses and final exam, but they were enjoyable if you actually cared about the content of the class. The TAs were super friendly and supportive. I would highly recommend taking any of Professor Mankekar's courses - and this course was exceptional."
Purnima Mankekar,NA,"Sex, Race, and Difference in Transnational Film",FILM TV M124,N/A,"Mankekar is a lovely women but I just didn't care for a lot of the material she teaches.  She is very strict about attendance and administrative stuff but she wants to see her students succeed, remembers students names and encourages students to talk to her if they are struggling with the material or just life stuff. The class is based off Two short film/reading analysis papers, two exams (multiple choice) and class discussions/attendance. She does podcast but attendance is mandatory because of group discussions.  Its more of a gender studies class than film &tv class (it is multi listed though) and I just didn't like the readings she assigned.  I'm a poli sci major so this was not my element. My TA was Lina she was great but I just struggled with the material. I'm writing this before my grade is final but I think I'll end up with a B+/B in the class."
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A+,"Professor Yan is a good professor. He speaks very slowly so his speaking is very clear. However, lectures can feel long and boring because of this especially for someone like me who is not super interested in this subject. The readings were sometimes long and uninteresting to me but they were manageable. Towards the end of the quarter I stopped reading all of them because well they were long and I was lazy. I recommend you read most of them so you can have something to talk about in discussion. Otherwise you will have a very boring and awkward time in zoom discussion meetings. Also, Professor Yan did not make us purchase a textbook which I always appreciate. The midterms and final were straightforward and there was a lot of information to pull from in the readings. There is a one page writing assignment every week and you are required to attend discussion for participation points. It's a slow paced class and an easy GE that does give you an appreciation for anthropology."
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A+,"I would recommend taking this class. It's definitely an easy GE and the professor is efficient and clear. I enjoyed the discussions, and to get credit you just need to talk around 1-2 times. Weekly written 1-page reflections were required but those were double-spaced and really easy."
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A-,I would recommend taking this class. It's a relatively easy GE and the professor is efficient and pretty clear. Weekly written 1-page reflections were required but those were double-spaced and super easy. I put in a mid amount of effort and ended up with an A-.
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A+,"This was a very interesting class and I'm glad I took it.  Yan was very friendly and tried give us a good general background in anthropology.  The lectures could get boring sometimes, but if you actually paid attention to what he was saying and tried to think critically about the concepts, you could get a lot from it.  There were a few readings a week which were pretty interesting, and the exams were just short answer questions, which drew from concepts covered in the lectures and the readings and asked for examples.  I imagine it might be harder in person, but because I took it online, we were allowed access to the readings, notes, and recorded lectures to reference in our responses, so it wasn't hard at all.  Also we had 24 hours.Overall, very interesting class with a very nice professor.   Yan also has a very interesting background growing up as a farmer in China and fleeing the Communist Revolution, which he sometimes talks about and relates concepts to.  I would recommend this class, especially to anyone interested in Anthropology (but I would recommend anthro 4 more if you're trying to choose between them, as I found anthro 4 more interesting and exciting)."
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A,"Super easy class, I completely recommend to anyone who is considering it, especially with Yan. I never took great notes because he uploaded all the slides to CCLE so it didn't really matter. Sweet man, hard to understand at times but very passionate about the topics at hand. The weekly reflections were extremely easy and basically graded on just submitting it. All you need to do is show up to discussions and study using the slides for a day or so for the midterm and final and you'll be golden."
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A+,"Exams and participation in discussion rely on you being able to draw main ideas from lectures and readings and being able to explain them or discuss how lecture ideas and readings relate to each other.  If you can do that, then you'll have no problem with this class."
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A+,"-Very easy class-The exams require examples/evidence from reading, so at the very least skim them so you know what topics are covered when you need to cite them in exam-our exam was open notes, 24 hours (Covid)-readings are a bit long but its not too bad"
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A+,"Overall an easy class.  Every week, you had to turn in a response dealing with one thing we found interesting on the lectures of the week and one thing from the readings of the week. Midterm and finals were each 3 short essay questions that you have 24 hours to complete (but that won't be the case once we return to in-person classes).  Lectures are often dull and readings are quite dense.  But getting an A is not a problem."
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A,"Yan is an adorable old professor, but he does have an accent that may hinder his clarity in lecture. In lecture, he goes through slides very, very slowly, so he's not really that engaging. That being said, if you pay at least 80% attention and take note of the ethnographic examples he gives, you can definitely do well in this class. The midterm and final were both very straightforward: 3-4 short essay questions on some themes touched on in class. The readings are pretty crucial in providing context and examples of the concepts in lecture, and are actually really interesting sometimes. I recommend reading them just so your discussion sections can be more than 50 minutes of Zoom silence. However, be prepared for about 20-30 pages of reading per week. Overall, this class was super easy and interesting. I highly recommend it for anyone who is even mildly interested in cultural institutions and society's evolution."
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A+,"Super interesting class. Midterm was straightforward and really focused on main elements of anthropology. It was a bit harder to condense all information on one page for each final question, but whatever ig. Prof. Yan is a super sweet adorable guy and honestly the class was a good idea for someone who needs a GE. Nikhit was a good TA and really fair plus discussions were really engaging. Glad I took this class."
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A+,"Professor Yan is an awesome professor, and I would recommend him for anyone that has to take Anthro 3 for major requirements or wants to take the class as a GE. He runs the class with a great deal of understanding and compassion for students. For example, he dropped our Week 8 ethnographic paper because he knew that it would be a particularly busy time for students.For me, this one of the more time-intensive GEs that I've taken, but I do think the workload is both reasonable and manageable. I found the multiple choice part of the exams to be a little tricky, but as a whole the tests were very fair. My TA was Alex, and I'd highly recommend him! Overall, this is a great class."
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,B+,This class requires a lot of reading for the discussions. The lecture itself is based solely on his lecture slides; you'll do well on the midterms if you can basically regurgitate how he explains concepts and be sure to memorize the examples he gives. I don't recommend taking this if you're taking it with a heavy-course load because of all of the assigned reading.
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,B+," Professor Yan has a thick accent, so sometimes it is hard to understand what exactly he is saying. Luckily, he uses slides and foes through them very slowly. With that said, lecture can get very boring, very quickly. It is important that you pay attention in lecture though because the content discussed in lecture is heavily present in the midterm and final. Homework is to develop two complex questions; one from the reading and one from lecture. Reading is very helpful to understand lecture, but you can honestly just skim it. The midterm is fairly simple (20 MC, 2 SA). The final is similar in format (40 MC, 2 SA). Make sure to attend the study review. I'm sure if I did, I would've secured an A."
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A," I have the textbook for sale!!!! 6182079032  This class was very interesting and straightforward. I would definitely recommend this class as a GE. Dr. Yan's lectures are very interesting and funny, but he does drift off topic often. The tests are very straight forward, make sure to study all of the key terms from the different chapters in the textbook and read the slides carefully. The supplemental readings are not tested on, but they are used for the weekly reading reflections; the reading reflections are very simple.   I have the textbook for sale!!!! 6182079032"
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A,"Grading:10% participation (showing up to discussion)20% homework (writing 2 questions a week with a little analysis/background, about a page double spaced, graded for completion basically)30% midterm40% finalThis class was so easy. Very minimal effort needed for an A. It was also pretty interesting, although during lecture the professor would spend like 15 minutes on each slide. In the class you learn about ""simple"" cultures and different aspects of their society, such as family or power relations, spirituality/religion, and their economies.  The midterm and final had the same format: 20-25 multiple choice questions, and 2 written response questions. There were three questions to choose from and you picked whichever two you liked. They were very easy, and the multiple choice question were heavily based on the textbook, especially the vocab. Only bad thing about the class was discussion was useless, but you had to go to get participation points. I took this class as a GE and cannot recommend it more highly. TAKE IT!!!"
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A,"I loved this class! If you're looking for an easy GE this is the class for you. In addition, you will learn a lot from the class itself and its super eye opening. Dr. Yan is an amazing guy, who has lead a great life. Given his life experiences, he teaches with an interesting perspective. The only issue I had is that Dr. Yan tends to be a tad bit boring at times."
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A, Prof Yan drops major truth bombs in this class. He has lived such a fascinating life and genuinely cares about making sure you get something out of the class. Tests are made of multiple choice and short essays. Study textbook definitions for MC and the slides for short essays. Highly recommend! This class has changed how I see myself and the world. And  the tests are not too bad. One day Prof Yan showed up to lecture and just cancelled the essay! What a legend!
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A,"Professor Yan has a crazy backstory and often incorporates interesting examples in lecture, but also lecture isn't really necessary. Just find key terms from each unit and study them for the midterm and final. Akua as a TA was amazing. Interesting class if you look for it, but it could be boring, depending on who you are."
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A,"There is one midterm and a final, a 5 page paper, and weekly reading responses for this class. The midterm and final were heavily based on the key terms from the book so if you study those and the main topics talked about you should be fine. The paper was graded pretty easily ( I believe the average was an 89%). The lectures were somewhat difficult to follow, but as long as you understand the big ideas and themes you should be okay."
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,B,"Professor Yan is a nice man, but his lectures are very boring and consist of him going off on tangents. He spends a lot of time talking about each slide, so much that he was behind schedule since he continued his lectures going into the following week. There were reading responses due for weeks 2-6, which I found pretty pointless. The midterm and final weren't bad, they consisted of multiple choice and a few short-response questions. Most of the content on the exams came from lecture and the readings from the textbook; the supplementary articles are practically worthless. There was also a 5 page ethnographic observation paper that required us to go do fieldwork at either Wooden, Trader Joe's, or the farmer's market. Overall, this class was okay and definitely requires some effort to do well."
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,Yan is a very effective and passionate professor.  He loves the subject and is able to bring a lot of his own experiences into the lectures.  I think that this was my favorite and most helpful class at UCLA.  It has helped me for every other social science class I have taken and I think that everyone should take this class.  The midterm and final are not very hard if you study.  Discussion can be dry but its only once a week.  The lecture is great though.  Sit at the front of the lecture though because sometimes his accent and soft voice is hard to understand.  Take this class!
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,He is passionate about the subject matter and it shines through in his lectures.  The class is a great into to cultural antho and I have found that what I have learned is very applicable to other subject areas.
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A," I took this class Winter 2008, I went into it as a science major thinking this class would be SUPER easy because of the low difficulty rating, it turns out the class is only marginally easy. Even though the two short papers were easy to write, getting an A on the tests actually required a firm grasp of the material. To get an A on the final and hence the class I actually had to read some of the book.  In short, this is an easy class to get a B in, the A might require a little work."
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"If you are an anthro major, take Yan over any other prof. for anthro 9. If you aren't an anthro major, I highly recommend this class as a GE. In terms of work load, the class is minimal. Unlike other anthros that require at least one 5 page paper, this class only required two 2 page papers: not bad! The tests are very simple and straight forward if you have gone to every lecture. I did not read the book, and only missed a single multiple choice question between both exams, perfect on the short answers. In terms of grade distribution, the class had over 200 students in it, 20 of who got A+'s, 50 of who got A's, and 20 of who got A-'s. I think that is enough said in terms of grading. One small caveat, Dr. Yan is Chinese and very interested in how his native culture compares to American ""culture."" Therefore, majority of the examples he will give you involve anecdotes from his life. Many students complained because they were sick of hearing about China. Personally, I found it interesting, but many were bored with it. Easy material to conceptualize, low work load, very interesting: highly recommended class."
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"Professor Yan was a very dynamic lecturer--I'd recommend sitting up front though, because his accent does sometimes prevent you from understanding what he says when he's using the microphone. I like anthropology, so that might be why I loved this course, but I think he did a great job at making it accessable to everyone. If you have the option to do the honors seminar, I'd 100% recommend that too. There isn't too much work and it's incredibly rewarding."
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"Professor Yan is a great professor, who knows his material inside and out. It may be hard to understand his acccent sometimes,  but he tries especially hard to help his students understand the course material.  Not an easy easy A, but is definitely do-able if you keep up with the readings and attend lecture."
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"The subject matter of the class is pretty much dry and boring. Yan tries to make it better by telling personal stories and going on a little tangents. The guy has an accent and badly misprounces a few words, ""whales"" when saying ""wheels,"" but still it's not too hard to figure out what he's trying to say given the context. What sucks the most about this class is that the material is insanely easy, but the grading is actually pretty hard if you don't feel like reading through hundreds of pages of dry and wordy anthro text. There's no way to not understand the material as there's almost no analysis or original thought required on his tests. But you must be able to list and describe exactly what he is looking for on test essays because he has an answer key in which he gives points for particular answers. If you don't have his answer then you don't get points.If you're passionate about hunter and gatherers, is good at remembering things, can stay awake in lectures, and have a bit of psychic ability when answering essay questions then you're sure to love this class. If you're a science major looking for an easy GE with minimal reading and a sure A then look elsewhere. I was duped by the good reviews on bruinwalk. Took the class, found it boring, went to class most of the time but didn't read much, and got a B."
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Globalization in Context,GLBL ST 110A,A+,"I was looking for some readings from this class on line and somehow got into this page. Looking at it I realized I might be the last class of students who actually participated in the program and this review might not be helpful at least in the next few years.  Even more so, if I hadn't decided to participate in the program a year early, I might have also lost the opportunity to participate as well. While my current status absolutely turned this course into a once in a life-time experience, I'd say objectively I also learnt quite much from the class in a chill way. During the pre-departure conference I said I chose this program as I wanted to learn more about the country in which I grew up deeper through different perspectives, and I did achieve that goal through the class. Professor Yan's unique background made him capable of understanding the unique feature of the country and the city, which brought tremendous value to me. Though I might not be able to change my current situation, I still feel lucky that at least I can understand the essence of it based on what I learnt from the class. Well, honestly I didn't realize how much I learnt from this course plus how much Professor Yan influenced my life until recently, as it suddenly (actually not quite sudden) becomes so relevant to my life. But in 2019, what I enjoyed more was actually the schedule and design of the course. We got plenty of time to explore the city by ourselves as Professor Yan strongly encouraged us to do so. This may be the last normal summer I've had, and I'll miss it for the rest of my life.Ok - sorry about making the comment too personal - but I guess it's fine cause I think the program will not resume at least for the next few years. But I genuinely wish my prediction is wrong."
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Ideology and Social Change in Contemporary China,ANTHRO 163P,A,"I love Yan. He is too sweet. His class is fair, but I don't like the midterm/final/basically nothing else class format for grading. This being said, he is chill, just, and curves up. I had Sinski as a TA and he is stellar (literally the best TA ever). The class content is interesting, but Dr. Yan lived through it. His life story & intelligence is legit inspiring."
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Ideology and Social Change in Contemporary China,ANTHRO 163P,A,"Take this class! Professor Yunxiang Yan is an exceptional professor. His lecture style is very organized and concise. He uses slides and provides online readings that are important for the midterm and final-exam. The readings are anywhere between 25-55 pages a week (Yet, engaging and interesting). You have to complete a weekly reflection on the lectures and reading assignments on CCLE. The midterm and final are two parts: the first part is short written answer questions, and the second is a longer essay answer (1000 word limit). There is no study guide for the exams but take notes and utilize the slides. The best part is his own testimony and experience growing up in the Chinese Revolution. He has designed this class in an exceptional way and its engaging, highly recommend!"
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Ideology and Social Change in Contemporary China,ANTHRO 163P,A,"Professor Yan was amazing. As in class and in this review, this is not a history class but rather an analysis on how the Communist government shaped and reshaped the social and cultural cognition of the Chinese population into modern times. It was a really fun class where I learned about the development of China's social and cultural landscape, and being Chinese American with family who grew up during the era, it was super interesting to see how policies affected people in different ways, and the contrasts between regions of China. It was also super interesting listening to Professor Yan's own experience growing up in that era. We also had a super amazing TA who was both funny and knowledgeable. She made everything 10x clearer and it was interesting to hear her stories as well as an earlier generation Chinese American. The class is graded on discussion participation (super fun btw), and a written midterm and final where the questions and answers are largely covered in lecture."
Yunxiang Yan,NA,Ideology and Social Change in Contemporary China,ANTHRO 163P,N/A,"Prof Yan is such a great professor. Class was interesting and funny~ Prof Yan always tell you his own personal stories, which makes the class even more interesting.  midterm/final time he would look over the assigned readings to pick out the *important* ones for you to study for the time.  Test not so hard, pretty straightforward, as long as you do the *important* readings then you should have no problem.  He also tries really hard to grade the tests so you can get them back faster!  Yan is such a dedicated Professor!! If only he taught other department courses~"
Li Min,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A,"Super easy GE, i finished the course by W8. Two 3-4 page papers but he drops the lowest and 5 quizzes during the quarter and also drops lowest so I only needed to do one paper and 4 quizzes. My TA only took attendance grades for 8 weeks so once I had enough I stopped going. Quizzes mainly based on lecture and not the readings. If there was a problem on the readings, I usually just hunted for the answer during the quiz instead of reading it before. Copy paste the lecture transcripts into a word doc to find some answers and have ppts up for quiz"
Li Min,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A," This dude is the goat. Clearly passionate about anthropology/archaeology and it really shows. Going into this class, I was kind of skeptical because archaeology just sounds like digging in dirt yada yada yada. I was gravely mistaken. Yes, you learn about digging stuff, but there's a big focus on human origins and how they came to be and all that, super interesting. Fair amount of reading but honestly not that bad. This class even counts towards the historical analysis GE category, and I 100% recommend this class over some typical boring and dense history class (history isn't my thing). 2 papers, 5 quizzes but he drops the lowest in each category so, like other reviewers here, I was done with this class by Week 7/8 which was great. Just copy his slides and write down what he says on a doc for quizzes as everything is open note, but if you pay attention to lectures you should be fine anyway. Shoutout to Kristine Chua, best TA! Would always take some time to briefly summarize lecture material and was super kind and knowledgeable. Take her if you can if she TA's for this class (or any other class) again!"
Li Min,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A," Prof. Li was the most accommodating and nice professor I've encountered during at-home learning. He pre-recorded his lectures and uploaded them onto CCLE, and you can view them right before a quiz and get an A. While this was nice, sometimes he would go over the slotted amount of time for lecture, as he often rambles about his personal experiences (though his work is super interesting to learn about!) He also tends to ramble a lot during office hours, so make sure someone keeps him on track or else he'll spend a majority of his OH answering 1 question. Overall, super cool professor and easy GE to get an A. Class grade is split by:Discussion section: 10%Papers (best 1 of 2): 30%Quizzes (best 4 of 5): 60%"
Li Min,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A,"EXTREMELY easy GE! If you need to fulfill your historical analysis/ social analysis GE, I would recommend you to take this class. Your grade is determined by your best four quizzes out of five and your best paper out of two. If you do well on the first four quizzes and first paper, you do not have to do any work for that class after since they will be dropped anyway. The quizzes consisted of ten questions each and the answers could be found in the lectures. Some questions were from the readings, but they were not super specific and they tended to be more general questions about the readings. The lectures were extremely dry and the professor definitely did go off on a tangent about unrelated topics for over an hour, so thank goodness they were prerecorded + 2x speed! We did have six mandatory discussion meetings with our TAs and during those discussion sections, our TAs helped us better understand and highlighted the key points of the professor’s lectures. They also attempted to engage us by discussing the readings, but majority of us did not do it prior to the discussion section haha. I felt super bad for the TAs since they would ask questions and it would go *crickets*. But yeaahhh, I personally did not learn much from this class, but it was super easy so (:"
Li Min,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A,"If you need a chill GE during COVID, I suggest taking this class. There was no midterm or final for the class, only 5 quizzes every other week (lowest score dropped) and 2 papers (lowest score dropped)  Since the lowest score was dropped, you could essentially skip 1 if you got good enough scores on the previous tests/paper.  I can't guarantee it will be like this in future quarters but even if it wasn't the tests weren't hard at all."
Li Min,NA,Chinese Civilization,CHIN 50,A+," I took this class remotely, so I can't say how it is normally.  But like other people have said, it's not a free A.  I wouldn't consider it an easy GE.  The majority of the class (including myself) was confused as to what was happening for much of the quarter.  I think the only reason this class was alright for me is because I had a pretty good understanding of Chinese history beforehand. Grades were based on a scores from 4 pop quizzes, a presentation, discussion participation, a midterm, a final exam, and a final paper.  We didn't have any other assignments, so this really is one of those classes that relies on just a few assignments. As for the professor, his lectures didn't feel useful.  He's an archeologist, and the first half of his lectures reflect that quite a bit.  Lectures felt pretty unorganized, so after the midterm, I honestly just stopped watching the lectures and relied on the textbook instead.  PLEASE GET ACCESS TO A TEXTBOOK IF YOU CAN!!  It's probably the only reason I got the grade I did. For the final paper, I'd 100% recommend asking your TA for feedback before you submit.  It helps you know exactly what they're expecting, which was important since we didn't get a rubric or anything.  Final paper was 20% of our grade.  Other than that, just be sure to put effort into your presentation and try to talk during discussions."
Li Min,NA,Chinese Civilization,CHIN 50,A+," I have mixed feelings about this class.  THE GOOD: This class is very easy if you know what to put emphasis on. That means-- take advantage of the midterm and final study guide. Retrieve past exams from the test bank. Write a decent 7-8 pg paper and get help from your TA!!! The group discussion presentation was not too bad either. THE BAD: Lectures are very dense, extensive, often convoluted, and extremely boring. He mostly goes into his archaeological research which can be irrelevant to the exams. However, he does try to tie it into the civilizations we are trying to learn. Taking lecture notes is not really necessary. The only important thing to extract from lecture is probably the location of certain places on the map which we were tested on. In addition, there are A LOT of readings in this class. (50-100+ pages a week from the textbook, sourcebook, and other online files). Some of these texts are in confusing chinese-to-english translation, so it feels like one would be much better off if they are already somewhat familiar with the texts if they came from a Chinese background. I failed most of the section quizzes (avg 60%) which were based on the most specific details that I had overlooked in the textbook and/or sourcebook or some of which I believe they had never explicitly mentioned in any of the texts I had read. I did not understand how most people got 90-100% on those because those were genuinely difficult for me. Overall, I would not say this class is an easy GE. You have to know what you must do to get an A. I feel like if I had not utilized resources such as the test bank or realized that lecture material would not help me much on the exam, I would probably be studying a lot of useless material and not get the grade I had gotten."
Li Min,NA,Chinese Civilization,CHIN 50,A+," To succeed in this class, I suggest the following based on my experience this quarter: Paying some amount of attention during lecture, especially during the first half of the class (week 1-3) which may be hard because he often talks about archaeologyReading and comprehending the main textbookGiving a decent amount of effort and time for the final essay. If your TA will be grading the essay, get as much feedback from them as possible, and shape your essay to suit what they are looking for.And if there are quizzes given in section that are anything like the ones I took, pay attention to the details in your reading from the main textbook. You'll need some memorization skill. You will not need to read the sourcebook. I think the class was curved rather graciously since 86% of students got a 90% or above on the final exam."
Li Min,NA,Chinese Civilization,CHIN 50,A+," OVERVIEW:Discussion: 30%>>> 12% Quizzes, 13% Participation, 5% PresentationMidterm: 20%>>> 20 possible points; consisted of multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank Final Paper: 20%>>> literary analysis on one of several preassigned topicsFinal Exam: 30%>>> over 40 possible points; consisted of multiple choice and short answer While I recognize many faults in this course, I admit that I enjoyed it.  The content itself is interesting and Professor Li is very knowledgeable.  However, this course was also a huge source of stress early in the quarter. Therefore, this review is somewhat mixed, as was my overall experience with the course.Unlike many other courses I took, there were no clicker questions or practice problems to gage how well I understood the material, which made it especially stressful when preparing for midterms.  This was only amplified by the fact that the midterm consisted merely of 20 multiple choice questions, so each missed question was a percentage point off the final grade.  There also seemed to be a discrepancy between the TAs' quizzes and Professor Li's tests.  The quizzes often drew on details from the reading, some of which seemed insignificant when preparing.  Meanwhile, Professor Li's tests were, fortunately, very straightforward and tested on major themes from his slides.  He never gave us trick questions and drew mostly on the textbook.  His lectures were sometimes unclear, as much of the content he covered (mainly archaeological material) was complex and did not appear on the tests.  He also used a ton of wordy slides, over a 1000 in total, which made studying for the final very time-consuming.Despite the course's flaws, there were many aspects I enjoyed.  I took this course because I loved learning about China in AP World History, which I took back in high school.  This course really expanded on China's history and, impressively, managed to do so in the span of a few weeks.  The textbook and sourcebook were both very interesting to me.  One of my favorite assignments was watching the film ""To Live"" when studying the People's Republic, which really enriched the course.  The TAs did a great job at selecting readings and assignments.  Professor Li's archaeological studies, while they sometimes made his lectures more confusing, were really interesting to me.  He has a very comprehensive knowledge of Chinese history and is eager to talk to students after class and during office hours.  Last, but most importantly, he and the TAs are very open to feedback and made significant improvements between the midterm and the final.  The final exam was significantly longer than the midterm and consisted of short answer questions (including an extra credit question) that allowed students to demonstrate their overall knowledge of the course.  The papers seemed to have been graded fairly and the TAs were very helpful in addressing student concerns.  Professor Li also created study guides and, if you answered each part of them using his slides, they made the tests a lot easier.I feel like, if the course hadn't had such a rocky start, I may have gotten a lot more out of it.  The course is a mixed bag, not because there is anything wrong with the professor or the curriculum, but because the way its organized made it a lot more stressful.  However, Professor Li is very concerned with student success and is willing to work with anyone who is struggling.  I'd recommend this course for those with a genuine interest in Chinese history and/or archaeology.  If you just want to get rid of a GE, this might not be the best course, as I often considered it my hardest course over my STEM prerequisites.  However, it's a very rewarding experience if you put the time and effort into it.  Overall, I'd give this course a 3.5/5, although I feel the last few weeks warrant a higher score."
Li Min,NA,Chinese Civilization,CHIN 50,A-,"I pretty much agree with the answer stating that it is VERY IMPORTANT to consult your TA about the paper before you actually submit. Different TA's might have very different criteria about what a good paper should look like. I used my usual paper style from other history classes but got a very low grade for this one. Also, certain questions in pop up quizzes are very hard (they are based on very small details in lengthy readings) and require quite a lot preparation. Overall I wouldn't say it is a very easy class, I studied very hard for the midterm and final so I could save my grade."
Li Min,NA,Chinese Civilization,CHIN 50,A+,"Professor Li Min is an archaeologist who studies intensively about Chinese history and culture. He is very passionate about what he teaches and that is apparent through the lecture. Sometimes this meant that his lectures were quite confusing and hard to pay attention to because he was incredibly knowledgeable about the subject matter. Nevertheless, it's an interesting class. He would go in depth beyond what the textbook talked about, so I found that studying lecture slides for the final was crucial. DO NOT FALL BEHIND ON THE READINGS! The sourcebook isn't as important but it's really important that you read the textbook because you get quizzed on it in discussions. I found that there was sometimes a lack of communication between the TA and the professor which was confusing at times. I took this class hoping it would be an ""easy A"" for my GE requirements but this was not quite the case. The class was occasionally frustrating and confusing, especially because of the overload of information during lectures- Chinese history is complicated! But overall a very interesting class, and looking back now I am glad I put in the work and was able to learn so much about my own culture. Li Min is always happy to help, so if his lectures seem confusing don't hesitate to visit him or the TA's in office hours. He provides a study guide before the midterm and final, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS! The study guide is the reason I got an A in this class and thanks to the study guide, it actually made the midterm and final test pretty easy.  Professor Li Min is a really cool person :)"
Li Min,NA,Chinese Civilization,CHIN 50,A," Li Min is a lecturer, not a teacher. He obviously knows what he's talking about, and demonstrates really good knowledge. But it seems like he's more interested in talking about his material/own archaeological work than making sure the class knows the material. That being said, my man made all the quizzes extremely easy, and really made the class easier for us. He doesn't really care about the class too much, for 3 of the 5 quizzes, he forgot to scramble answers, so the right answer was just the first choice. 5 quizzes per quarter, one gets dropped, so each one is worth 10%. If you mess these up, you are an idiot ngl. This class comes down to your TA and only your TA. Shoutout Kirie Stromberg for 1. being proposed to, huge congrats 2. probably feeling happy about getting married and giving me 100% on my essay. Final essay is 6-8 pages double spaced, you make your own topic for 30% of the grade. Discussion participation is mandatory and counts for 30% of your grade. Camera has to be on (Li Min made it online like the mf g he is)."
Li Min,NA,Chinese Civilization,CHIN 50,A,"I took this class remotely during the pandemic so I think the class was easier than it normally would have been. Midterm and final were open note and the professor gave us a study guide that pretty closely followed the test content. Make sure to collaborate with people on the study guide because its pretty lengthy. The midterm was all multiple choice and the final was multiple choice and some frq--these tests saved my grade. Pop quizzes were harder to get good scores on. As for the final essay, get feedback from your TA like all the other responses said. Like everyone else said, the first couple lectures (maybe until week 3?) are more archaeological based and not really helpful. But in the second half of the quarter I found that the lectures got better. Slides become more helpful later in the quarter as well. However, the textbook is also pretty good and you can do fine with just the textbook. (Although some things are more covered in the lectures than in the textbook.) If you're taking this class remotely, it won't be too bad. I probably wouldn't have gotten a good grade if it was taught normally in person."
Li Min,NA,Chinese Civilization,CHIN 50,A+," Taken online, so experiences may vary. Personally thought the class was really easy and interesting despite having no background except for AP World History before this class. However, others in groupchats I was in seemed to be constantly stressed about this class, so I may be an anomaly. Due to the remote nature, Prof. Li recorded lectures that were 1-2 hours long and had us watch them on our own time. They were mostly slide-based and the slides were posted afterwards. For better or worse, you could tell which topics were more interesting to him because he would go more in-depth and show many pictures about them, whereas other slides might be just bullet points.Midterm/Final were multiple choice/short answer and were fairly straight-forward, just facts from the lectures/readings. My understanding is that for in-person classes, he would test more heavily on geography, but he did not in the remote setting. Nevertheless, I would still suggest getting familiar with Chinese geography just because it makes it easier to understand what's happening.Lectures can sometimes be a bit long/tangenty, but I enjoyed them. TA sections were very different than lecture, focusing on the readings, which were more literature/cultural based instead of purely historical. Quizzes were all based on literature, which can be difficult, especially if you aren't used to differentiating Chinese names and stuff.TA discussions were just the TA reading slides about the topics covered and then a student-led group presentation about the topics again.I spent a long time on the final paper because I'm a pretty poor writer, but it was graded pretty generously in my opinion (or I was really lucky).I was personally less interested in this stuff, but it was a manageable amount of reading. The bar for discussion was kinda low, so if you participated at all, I think you would have gotten a good grade for participation. Prof Li is a very nice person and very willing to answer questions.  So while we did not have in-person lectures, he did have ""interaction times"" to talk and ask questions. Overall, if you're interested in history, I found the class really interesting and learned a lot from it. If you're not, you might be bored."
Li Min,NA,Chinese Civilization,CHIN 50,F,"I'm a graduating senior who needed to fulfill the Philosophical/Linguistics requirement so I took this class. The TA was more interesting than the professor. I never went to lecture because I kept falling asleep during the first two lectures. I never did the readings and on the three quizzes (each one 10 points) I earned 10/30 points total as my quiz grade. I did manage 80% on the midterm and I always went to the discussions, which were mandatory. I'm not sure how I did on the final exam and on the final paper, but I passed soOOOooOOOoooOOo. Overall, the material was not that interesting to me but this class is not challenging to pass. Most of my friends got As in this class so I assume the curve is generous. I just wanted a peace of mind that my laziness was not going to cost my GPA."
Li Min,NA,Chinese Civilization,CHIN 50,A,"Just one fact to tell. I'm a Chinese-background student, but I was below median in midterm, final, and paper. Maybe I'm too vegetable! Fortunately, I received an A, as Professor Li himself is a really nice and helpful guy."
Li Min,NA,Chinese Civilization,CHIN 50,F,"I just got out of the final and I just wanted to recap for future students who are thinking of taking this class. First of all, this is not an ""easy"" GE. If you are looking for GE where you can get away with an A with minimal effort, this class IS NOT for you. I had to solely rely on the textbook to study for the tests because the lectures were not very effective. The professor would often go on tangents and talk about material that was not going to be tested on. I am not completely bashing on this class, though. The professor provided us with study guides so we can know what we needed to know for the test. These study guides were very reflective of what was going to be on the tests. The midterm consisted of only 20 multiple choice questions, which was a lot of pressure. The final consisted of 24 multiple choice questions, 2 map questions, and 6 short answers. If you are genuinely interested in Chinese civilization, then feel more than welcome to take this class. The professor is passionate about the topic and seemed like he always welcomed students to office hours. Overall, this class consisted of a lot of reading and memorizing. I honestly studied more for this class than my upperdivsion classes that I am currently taking for my major."
Li Min,NA,Chinese Civilization,CHIN 50,N/A,"He had much passion and is extremely knowledgable in materials and research related to Chinese civilization. But the course itself - or the way he tried to teach it, could be more organized than it was... and ... thousands of slides."
Li Min,NA,Chinese Civilization,CHIN 50,N/A,"Very unclear and unfocused class. I have no idea what to study for the midterm, in fact the professor did not provide any information for the midterm. Lectures and Textbooks are covering extremely different topics. Every single one of my classmates I've talked to are either confused or stressed heading into tomorrow's midterm. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS."
Li Min,NA,Chinese Civilization,CHIN 50,A,"Lmao, on the first day of class, li min just stared at the students and said ""wow probably 90% of students here are of east asian descent"""
Li Min,NA,Archaeology of South Asia,ANTHRO 116,N/A,I had him for 116N. Take this class. Get to know him! He is great and I really think you will enjoy him if you visit him in office hours and try to think about the interesting ideas he presents in class. He is very concerned about his students and will help you in any way he can.
Li Min,NA,Archaeology of South Asia,ANTHRO 116P,N/A,"I took Antho 116P as an incoming transfer student, not knowing what to expect from UCLA.  At first it seemed confusing, but throughout the course I learned so much about Ancient China that I was able to accurately guess the date of an Ancient Chinese artifact in a middle school text book based on what I learned in this class.  Really caring Professor, go to office hours to get the most out of the class.  :D"
Li Min,NA,Archaeology of South Asia,ANTHRO 116P,N/A,"Although he is sometimes difficult to understand, his class was interesting and I really enjoyed it. We had a take home midterm and final and a project that was pretty much open to whatever you wanted to do. He is a really nice guy and I would definitely take a class from him again."
Li Min,NA,Selected Topics in Archaeology of China,ANTHRO 116Q,A,"I took this class to satisfy a requirement as an anthropology major and I don't have much personal interest in archaeology, so I wasn't exactly expecting to love this class, but still it was largely bad. Professor Li does honestly seem like a nice person, but his lectures are really boring and he doesn't do a good job of making any of the things he's talking about interesting. But ultimately it didn't really matter too much whether or not I paid attention or even went to class because he gave a take-home midterm and final where all of the information was based on the book (and graded them easy; I got a multiple choice question marked wrong on the midterm and still got 30/30). Participation and attendance were required per the syllabus but the class was super empty by the third week and he never took attendance. I can personally vouch that I skipped about half the classes and still got an A (though I'm not sure the percentage breakdown). Overall, it's easy but if you're looking for a class that might catch your attention or teach you something interesting maybe look elsewhere."
Li Min,NA,Selected Topics in Archaeology of China,ANTHRO 116Q,A,"I can tell Professor Li is very smart and knowledgable in his field, but he is not a very concise or organized lecturer.  He basically just assigned his own book and lectured from it, but the book was WAY more clear than his lectures.  For example, we spent the whole first half of the quarter (literally 5 weeks) on ""background"" information on the landscape of China.  Although I understand that this is helpful for understanding the dynamics of state formation in China, he also teaches a whole other class called ""landscapes of China"" where this would be more relevant.  The actual bulk of the archaeological information felt rushed in weeks 6-9 and he never went into depth about the requirements of the book review.  His midterm was take home, which was really nice and I appreciated  it, especially considering that his lectures were sort of difficult to follow (he didn't really use slides, just maps and pictures).  The final is also take-home so I guess I can forgive him for the structure of the class.  He's really nice and wants students to succeed but I wish his lectures were more clear.  Oh yeah, his ""slides"" were labeled as ""Chinese Civilization 50"" which is another class he is teaching this quarter so I assume he just uses the same slides and pictures for all of his classes."
Li Min,NA,Selected Topics in Archaeology,ANTHRO 119,A,"Professor Li Min is very knowledgeable in his studies of archeology in Central Asia/ Eurasia. He provides all the powerpoint slides that he uses to teach. Professor Li will oftentimes go on rants while explaining certain topics such as the BMAC communities or Lapis Lazuli, but he does in a way that one can clearly tell that he has an indepth knowledge of the topic. The course grade is based off four assignments; an abstract of the research paper you are going to write, a 15-20 page research paper (expanding on a topic discussed in class), a group power point presentation (expanding on a topic discussed in class - can be done solo and you dont have to present if you decide not to due to your own personal reasons), and a commulative take home final. Enough time is given in between assignments, and the class is not all that demanding. The readings can be a little heavy, but they are provided by Professor Li and no books have to be purchased for this class. I would definitely take another class with Professor Li if I had the opportunity to."
Li Min,NA,Selected Topics in Archaeology,ANTHRO 119,A,"This was probably one of the most confusing classes I've ever taken. Prof Li is super nice and really passionate about archaeology, but he is very unorganized and jumps around a lot. It was hard to follow, but somehow I got an A. The whole class is a blur, and I retained nothing. Do the assignments. Even if you have no idea what you're doing or saying, you'll wake up the morning grades are posted (still confused about what on earth just happened) with an A."
Heather Loyd,NA,Careers in Anthropology,ANTHRO 141,N/A,"I had such high hopes for Prof. Loyd's course ""Careers in Anthro"" as an anthro major myself, but honestly the way she taught the course this fall quarter was not very engaging and the assignments consisted of very thorough research in anthro careers that was not at all related to the materials that guest lecturers discussed during the class. In addition, her graders are very, VERY meticulous when grading weekly assignments, which is really difficult bc losing 8 points or so literally brings your grade down SIGNIFICANTLY (like you won't be able to get an A if you lose more than 1 pt per each assignment). I haven't personally had issues with her, but I know that a few of my classmates brought up her grading system bc it isn't clear in the syllabus and there is no rubric for grading, and when they mentioned it to her apparently she was v dismissive towards their comments. honestly, just take the course if you need it for your major requirements bc all you do is listen to different guest lecturers every week, and submit a weekly assignment + final portfolio. otherwise, I wouldn't recommend her but it just sucks bc I was really looking forward to this class and was bummed by the way she treated students + her arbitrary grading scale."
Heather Loyd,NA,Careers in Anthropology,ANTHRO 141,A+,"I cannot emphasize how amazing Dr. Loyd is. She is so kind, generous, supportive, welcoming, and overall such an amazing Professor. The whole purpose of this class is to help you figure out what you want to be in the future and what you want to do after University. To be honest, I was not sure what I wanted to be, but after taking Dr. Loyd's class, I was more sure and confident than I ever have been about what I am aspiring to become. On top of all her advice, support, and generosity, she would go out of her way to bring guest speakers from different professions to help us students explore what we want to become in the future. This class is truly something that is not offered at just any college and Dr. Loyd is one in a million. I learned so much from her class and I benefited so much. We made our resumes very professional and were able to speak to people from all different types of professions. We also created a LinkedIn account which I never had before. These are tools that I never knew were necessary and now I am set for future job opportunities as I did this all in her class. She would always help us whenever we were stressed and said to not worry if we do not know what we want to be and that it is a process. I highly recommend her class as it is something you will not regret. I am more passionate about my major as well because of this class. The workload was very minimal as well since you do the work throughout the quarter and it was very manageable."
Heather Loyd,NA,Careers in Anthropology,ANTHRO 141,A+,"Dr. Loyd is a FANTASTIC lecturer. I remember taking this class because I was relatively unsure of how to apply my degree in anthropology, but this class was my saving grace. Her guest lecturers really allowed for me to see how to utilize my skills and transfer them to the workplace. She provided us with handouts that showed us how to put together our resumes, LinkedIn profiles, and create a portfolio that would showcase us as the best candidate for any job. I am so happy that this class exists, and cannot recommend it enough to anyone who is pursuing anthropology. It gave me a foundation that I have used in the workforce and I am forever grateful to Dr. Loyd!"
Heather Loyd,NA,Careers in Anthropology,ANTHRO 141,A+," Seeing the other responses on this page, I wanted to add my voice to the review of Careers in Anthropology based on my experience. I took this course with Dr. Loyd a few years ago, and it has remained a memorable class. As other reviewers mentioned, the course relies on guest speakers with a degree in anthropology to share their career journeys and advise us on how we may figure out our paths. Each guest spoke from a perspective of a different field, like UX Design or health care, which I found highly encouraging as it showed me the broadness of my opportunities after my bachelor's degree. My interactions with Dr. Loyd then complemented this feeling during office hours, where I spoke to her several times about my confusion about my potential career and heard about her life journey. Dr. Loyd and I have remained in touch after class ended, and I still check in with her about where I am in my career. My recommendation for those taking or considering this class is not to treat it as an ""easy A."" That is not the purpose of this class. Based on my experience, Dr. Loyd designed this course to be an extension of the UCLA Career Center, as many weekly assignments and the final portfolio encouraged me to engage deeper with the Career Center's resources. I remember bringing my projects, like our personality test results and résumé, to the Career Center and analyzing them with UCLA Career counselors before submitting them to class. This method was possible because our work in this class complimented the Career Center's resources and helped me learn how to self-reflect to prepare for my post-graduation journey as an Anthropology major. Finally, grading is still necessary as this course factors into your GPA. I will not discredit the other reviewers' experiences with this course element. However, I encourage those in this course to open communication lines with Dr. Loyd and her TAs if you have concerns AS YOU DRAFT AND OUTLINE your assignments for submission. I remember being proactive about asking during office hours or over email what was expected of me by Dr. Loyd and her TAs on SPECIFIC assignments. If I had it ready, I showed them an outline to get their opinions and incorporate their responses into my final draft. This approach worked for me and would help others concerned with their grades. This course requires work, but it is worth the effort if you engage with it as a career development workshop instead of a regular ""lecture and exam"" designed course."
Heather Loyd,NA,Careers in Anthropology,ANTHRO 141,A," This class is very tedious and unengaging.  I went into this course attentive and wanting to learn and participate, however by the end I found myself watching TikToks and scrolling through my phone instead. You do not really learn about careers specific to anthropology, but rather listen to guest lecturers who have at the bare minimum taken an anthropology course in the past and how they try to rudimentarily connect what they have learned with their current careers. These careers include some interesting ones such as UX researchers to some not so interesting ones, to me at least, including accountants and make-up artists. The assignments feel like busy work, such as taking personality tests and writing on what you found out about yourself, however the grading is very harsh, which seems odd considering you are writing about your subjective experience.  Finally the most frustrating part is how much she stresses having a perfect resume, when her resume and the sample resumes provided do not meet up to her own standards. We had to upload are resumes to VMOCK and achieve a score of 80/100 or higher. However, I uploaded hers and the sample resumes and their scores did not even get close to 80/100.  However, maybe I am just salty considering my resume got marked down despite my VMOCK score being considerably higher than hers. Overall this course and the grading just seem arbitrary."
Heather Loyd,NA,Careers in Anthropology,ANTHRO 141,A,"Although I personally did not have any direct communication with the professor, a number of my peers struggled with her attitude when talking to her out of the lecture setting. Her assignments are more tedious than they are difficult but with no clear grading rubric can be a little stressful. Overall, it's not hard and I did finish with a resume and LinkedIn profile of a much higher quality than I would have if I didn't do them for a grade, however, if you are looking for a really engaging class then this isn't it."
Heather Loyd,NA,Careers in Anthropology,ANTHRO 141,A-," The only thing I learned in Loyd's class is to avoid her in the future. Unhelpful, rude, (which falls into the realm of unprofessional), and unclear on expectations for assignments.  She's so specific when grading, but doesn't give the class guidance aka ""where was _____ mentioned?!?"" You can follow the prompt for assignments and still get points off for it ""being too short"" even though the page limit has been met, and we have been directed to not go over that limit. Overall confusion. I feel sorry for foreign students, because that can be confusing as well as misleading. This class is not worth the stress it caused me and my classmates. Avoid."

Heather Loyd,NA,Writing for Publication and Conference Presentations,ANTHRO 191HE,A,"This class was one of the best classes I've taken at UCLA, all under the guidance of Dr. Loyd. She is the most helpful professor to have for Lemelson classes, and having her as the last professor for the program before submitting your thesis is a lifesaver. I remember feeling so lost about my thesis at some point, and I met with Dr. Loyd to discuss it more in depth. Her guidance and sheer belief in my abilities pushed me to work harder and not lose hope. She is an incredible professor and overall human being. I feel confident in my video-editing skills and writing abilities after her guidance."
Heather Loyd,NA,Writing for Publication and Conference Presentations,ANTHRO 191HE,A," Dr. Loyd is an encouraging and supportive professor, especially helping the Lemelson cohort find confidence in our work. I remember my fellow cohort members and me fumbling with the concept of being ""experts"" in our chosen topics, particularly during this last course in the Lemelson series. Dr. Loyd helped us overcome our imposter syndrome and be comfortable presenting and defending our projects in class, at the Lemelson Conference, and at the UCLA Undergraduate Research Week Showcase. Her consistent support helped me and my fellow Lemelson scholars gain confidence in our research projects and have a sense of accomplishment once submitting our papers and presentations at the end of the class. My advice for this class is to be completely open about your feelings and concerns, as a considerable part of this last Lemelson course is to figure out your voice as a researcher. Dr. Loyd's class creates the perfect environment to discover what that voice is and help hone that into your project as you push toward graduation. Logistically, this is a class to finish up your Lemelson project, but take advantage of using this opportunity for self-reflection. Good luck! You got this!"
Heather Loyd,NA,Writing for Publication and Conference Presentations,ANTHRO 191HE,A," Dr. Loyd is a fantastic mentor who cares deeply about her students and their projects. As the last seminar of the Lemelson program, it's essential to stay on course--and she is determined to see you through the finish line. My advice is to attend every seminar (don't miss it!), be open and honest about issues and problems that you've run into, and work with Dr. Loyd to address those obstacles and clear the way for you to finish up your project and thesis. She will push you, but you must be proactive and willing to put in the effort at the end of the day. In addition to a wealth of advice on finishing the thesis and conference presentation, she will invite Lemelson alum to speak about their experiences. They are also a great source of advice for you, especially as all of them have had similar difficulties as you (trust me, bro). If you know how to ask for help, you will receive it.  Good luck!"
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,B,"I think Professor Fessler is really a hit or miss for people. I took this class during Winter 2020, and got a B mostly because of my own work ethic. I do think that the course content itself is extremely interesting as it deals with human evolution.The course consisted of weekly chapters and quizzes in an online format (the e-book was $60 I believe).  We would receive homework in our discussion sections that were due weekly, but they weren't incredibly difficult or time consuming). There was a midterm and a final, and that was the entirety of the course content and grade. His lecture style was engaging and he was kind of awkward/ funny in a way that made him fun to listen to. He had a lot of knowledge and cool fun facts related to the course content which made it enjoyable.  However, I wasn't a fan of Fessler himself. He is incredibly strict and does not have any type of leniency (that was up until Covid, he made the final optional when everything crashed and burned). He refused to record his lectures to encourage students to show up (he had a fun fact for that too), which ultimately ended up being inconsiderate of students who had other responsibilities or sometimes didn't want to show up to class. Overall not too terrible, but I didn't appreciate his tone about it. ALSO I once saw him literally tear a students midterm paper in half because she was erasing something on her exam two minutes past the deadline. She wound up leaving the room crying, it was really sad to watch. Point is, the course content and his presentation of it is very interesting and worthwhile, but his own character was somewhat unlikable to me."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A,"First off, I absolutely LOVE Fessler. One of the most knowledgeable, interesting, passionate, and quite frankly supportive professors I've had the pleasure of meeting during my time at UCLA. Is his class difficult? Absolutely. Anthro 1 with Fessler was by no means a ""joke"" or a ""walk-in-the-park""; his classes are rigorous, the midterms and finals are difficult and timing is most definitely constraint, he can come across as quite intimidating at first (mostly because of how accomplished he is in all areas of his life, his honestly unparalleled eloquence, and excellence in *everything*), and you may feel overwhelmed and/or overworked.This is coming from someone who was pre-med during my time at UCLA and will be beginning medical school this upcoming August; yes the difficult/workload is on par with classes like Chem 14D and Chem 153A in my opinion.That said, as someone who has consistently strived to get A's in all my classes, and often looks at Bruinwalk for reviews (and shies away from enrolling in classes in which I know getting an A will be especially difficult, because a high GPA is almost *essential* in the pre-med track), even I would STILL take this class. Why? Because Fessler is quite literally that amazing. His class will change you; your perspective; your approach towards academia and life; and if you engage in and succeed in the class, you will most likely even be afforded the opportunity to work more intimately with him in his undergraduate laboratory, FessLab.Again, the opportunities in this class are endless, and Fessler is one of the greatest professors at UCLA. This class is what you make of it, but I would 110% recommend enrolling with Fessler if you're privileged enough to do so."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,C," Alright so I don't know what these other reviews are on but Fessler is by far the worst professor I've ever had. He doesn't care about his students unless you're one of the five people that sit up front and raise their hand every few minutes. The tests are out of this world difficult. No joke, the average on the first midterm was a FAILING grade. Not gonna lie, I cried. I every other anthropology course I've taken, I've gotten A's, except for this one. And it wasn't just me struggling, my close friend took it with me so we got to sit and cry together. The TA I had, while nice enough, SUCKED at actually helping me. I wanted to switch to P/NP and she told me to 'wait for my second midterm grade to come in'. So I listen because she's told me they'll be graded and ready soon. Two weeks go by, the deadline to switch the grading basis has passed, and I still don't have my test grade, and she tells me 'oh well I guess you'll just have to do really well on the final' even though she KNEW that wouldn't be possible.  TLDR; Fessler sucks and while the material is interesting, the formatting of the class, tests, and instruction, isn't it. Do not recommend."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A,"This was one of my favorite classes. The professor is so funny and definitely makes it so worth it to go to class. His explanations were overall easy to understand and super interesting. I definitely feel like its a class worth taking because I walked out of it with a greater understanding on us as a species and our behaviors. With that being said, the tests are pretty tough but the grading scale is quite fair (an 84 percent is an A). If you get the chance to take this class with this professor, definitely do so."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,B," I loved this class! Professor Fessler is a very engaging lecturer, and I feel like what I learned in this class is relevant to my life even though I'm not majoring in anthropology.  It's not the easiest class, which puts some people off, especially if they're doing it as a GE. However, it's not unreasonable. I feel like the grading scale was pretty fair, and if you put in the work, you'll probably end up with a good grade.  For homework, we'd have two brief writing prompts each week. We also had these online module things (inQuisitive, I think). Fessler didn't like them, and they were buggy but it was easy points. There were two midterms, and the second one was adjusted to be easier because people didn't have enough time to finish the first and Professor Fessler doesn't want time to be the reason you don't perform well.  Under the strange circumstances of the COVID-19 shutdown, we had a take-home final with six fairly straightforward writing prompts, each with a max length of 1 page. Obviously, for those of you who do your final in person, the format will be different. But I think it's important to note that he tried to be really fair with the unforeseen circumstances and gave everyone ample time to complete what I considered a fairly easy final (if you paid attention at all during the quarter) Overall, I think this class is really great and I enjoyed it a lot."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A,"This class didn't count to my major in any way but I took it because I was super interested and was not disappointed. The content is really so amazing and makes you understand human behaviors and societies with a lot more scientific explanation. The class starts with some biology and genetics before going into previous primate species, then eventually getting into homo sapiens and studying how we evolved our brains and diets to help us become one of the most successful species alive today and our cultures, fashion choices, physical differences etc.Fessler is super dedicated to the subject and has done a lot of work in this field. He also connects everything to very meaningful real world topics (ex. racism, climate change, etc.) Sometimes he goes off on tangents which I know can be a bit distracting but I honestly enjoyed them because they were usually funny and entertaining anecdotes. His exams were harder than I expected but still doable as long as you review the slides and don't get bogged down in details (you don't need to memorize as much as you might think!).  My TA was Steven and he was super positive and a really good TA. Homework was graded on completion but were useful to think about and go over in discussion."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,B+,"This class was very engaging but was also kind of hard. The workload was pretty light - 2 homework questions from the reading due in discussion and online inquisitive assignments every week. The book is not mandatory but it does help a lot with further understanding what he goes over in lecture. Inquisitive, however, is mandatory as it counts for a tiny percentage of your grade. There were 2 midterms and a final. The first midterm was pretty hard but the second one was a lot easier (if you study).  (For the first midterm we did not have to memorize all of the different species of apes - only the main differences between them). Because of the pandemic, our final this year was a written assignment that was optional. I think he made it pretty hard because we had so much time to work on it, but I didn't do it because I didn't want to drop my grade lower. Overall the material covered was engaging and Prof Fessler kept things interesting in class. He is also always available for office hours which is very nice."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A,"This class and professor have been my favorite at UCLA so far. Fessler is the most engaging professor I've had, his slides are very organized and he gives a lot of extra detail during lectures. I never missed a lecture even though it was at 10am, and I would skip the lectures I had after since they were so boring. Fessler keeps his lectures relevant and interesting, which is why I showed up to each one. Tests were difficult, but there's a curve built into the class so the cut off for an A is at 84%. It's not hard to get an A/B with this cut off as long as you study; tests aren't tricky, there's just a lot of info to know and conceptualize, but the questions are straightforward.  My TA was pretty easygoing and would let us out of section early most times. Inquisitive is tedious but not hard, it's an easy 100% worth 5% of your overall grade. Written homework is straight from the textbook and easy to find and there are only two questions per week. Overall, take this course if you have just a shred of interest in the topic and you won't be disappointed! It's a fair amount of work but if you like the material it won't feel so heavy. I'm really glad I took this course with this professor and would highly recommend other people take it too."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,B," I thought Anthro 1 would be relatively easy because it was an intro class. I thought wrong.  You are graded by completing InQuizitive quizzes, participation in discussion, two midterms and a final exam. I personally did not enjoy discussion section and did not find my TA to be helpful at all. The exams to be difficult and most of my class felt the same. The exams were very specific and made up of multiple choice, free response and fill-in-the-blank questions.  Midterm #1 average was 66%, Midterm #2 average was 69% and the Final exam average was 74%. Honestly, if it were not for his curved grading scale, I would have ended up with a C/D in the class.  I would not take this class again due to the stress it gave me. It was ridiculous how difficult the tests were for an intro class!!!"
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,F,This class was awful. The first midterm was straight up biology and genetics. The second midterm was a little easier but not by much. Overall the averages for the midterms were not good and I barely passed. The class is significantly curved but I -along with other students I knew- were barely passing. Most of the class was taking it for a GE but it was way too much work and too difficult for a GE. Do NOT take this class!!! I got lucky that COVID-19 made our final optional because I would've been screwed if I had to take it. The only thing good about the class was my TA who was super nice and genuinely cared about us. Fessler didn't seem to care about us since the class was so difficult. The Inquizitve quizzes are so annoying and so time consuming and really not an effective way to study for the midterms so they're a waste except they're part of your grade.
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A-,"Professor Fessler is a real cool and interesting guy. You can tell he knows a lot about anthro and he's super passionate. But ngl this was by far the most stressful class I have ever taken. I appreciate learning so much from Professor Fessler and my TA, but his tests are extremely difficult. The rubric is far more specific than what he leads on, and they are not worth a lot of points making it hard to get a decent grade without missing a single question. Getting a solid A is totally possible in this class, but make sure that you're willing to put some time and work in."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A,"Took it as a science GE, is pretty manageable. Fessler is a very funny and engaging lecturer; he often drops weird little facts or anecdotes in class, but I think that actually helped a great deal in explaining the concepts and making it relevant to our daily lives. Reading the textbook and doing the online quizzes helped me a lot. I do feel like I walked out of the class with a bit more insight on us."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A,"This was a cool class, really interesting subject matter. The tests were straightforward content-wise but the grading on essay questions was horribly arbitrary. They slash points like nobody's business if you miss certain components or key words that the TA was looking for. I took it as a GE and did well but would say it's pretty hard for a GE. Overall enjoyed the class though, take it if evolution is interesting to you."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"My favorite professor this year by far.  He teaches you so many random little facts and has a lecturing voice that I never felt tempted to fall asleep to.  The midterm and final are all writing and are not easy, the grades are curved.  Discussion stinks, but you gotta go.  Still think he's worth it, though."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"I took this class in Fall Quarter, yet I just realized that I didn't write a review.Fessler rocks! He is the best lecturer I have had all year, bar none. He keeps it interesting and has everyone engaged, even at 9:30 (when my class was). The class is tough and requires alot of time if you want to get it all and do well, but it is easily worth the time. I got a TON out of the class and I'm applying stuff from it almost every day- amazing considering I'm a PoliSci/Econ major.My highest recommendation."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A," i love professor fessler. taking his class made me decide to do an anthro minor or perhaps major. for homework, you read a chapter every week, which isn't so bad, and you do 2 or 3 homework questions. i wouldn't say it's EASY but it wasn't HARD either. i got a C on the midterm but got the 2nd highest grade on the final so i ended up with an A. Very interesting class, Awesome professor, Not a lot of work.  Highly recommend if you're interested in the material."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Dr. Fessler is an amazing lecturer!  I never felt bored or fell asleep in class because he really knows how to captivate his audience.  He is a dynamic speaker and very funny.  His tests are all short answer, but don't let that scare you.  All the questions are on the material emphasized in lecture and discussion, and he grades on a curve, which works to your advantage.  This is my third year at UCLA, and Fessler is one of my best professors I've had.  I can vividly remember almost everything he taught in lecture, even though I have a terrible memory.  He is that good!:)  If you have the opportunity to take any of his classes, I would highly recommend doing so."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Fessler is the most amazing professor that a student can ask for.  His lectures are amazing, he makes anthropology incredibly interesting, and he has a good sense of humor.  This class was no easy A though; I definitely had to work really hard, but it was so worth it.  After every lecture, I wanted to just give him a hug or standing ovation because he was just amazing.  The midterm and final are pretty difficult, but not tricky.  Study hard, you won't regret it."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A," I have nothing but praises for Professor Fessler. He is hard, don't get me wrong. You probably won't get an A. However, this is one of the most engaging classes I have ever taken at UCLA. His unorthodox style of lecturing is impressive and entertaining. He keeps the class' attention and he loves to teach. His tests are difficult. You have to study. But this class is well worth it.  His discussion sections are amazing as well. This is one of the only lower division social sciences classes that I have taken where discussion is somewhat useful. Prior to this class, discussions were pretty much a waste of time. However, Fessler uses this time to go over key concepts, re-enforce course ideas, and make sure that students understand the reading. If you're looking for an easy GE, don't take this class. If you're looking for an interesting, challenging GE, take this class. Fessler is an amazing professor."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"He is difficult, but an amazing prof.  It is more than possible toget an A just by studying and doing the reading.  His grading system is incredibly fair, he even guaranteed As to the sudents who do exceptionally well on the final, regardless of prior preformance in the class.  He cares a lot about the students and chances are you will even get a chance to go tolunch with him.  Take him, you won't regret it!"
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Proessor Fessler was very concerned about his students learning and is very approachable as well. He is very knowledgable in this field and is down to earth, so I definately recommend his class if you have to take Antro 7."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,An excellent professor- kept the subject matter icredibly interesting-- his lectures are quite an experience-- attend one to see what a good lecture really is.  Warning the tests were hard for an undergraduate course-- they were short answer- but if you knew the material-- if you keep up with reading you should have absolutely no problem.  Grading policy was weighted towards the midterm and final-- as always-- hw constituted little of the grade-- a fair guy if you bomb the midterm but ace the final yyou will do well in the course.
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,professor fessler is one of the most motivating professors at ucla.  the class is very interesting and it definitely teaches you about yourself and the people around you...how can someone say human evolution not be applicable to anything else other than satisfying a requirement?  if you're at ucla to take easy classes to get your degree then don't take his class (although it's not difficult) 'cause you don't deserve it.  fessler works very hard to make his lectures entertaining and interesting.  he prepares his lectures before hand and even puts up overheads to help you take notes.  how easy do you want it?  it's like high school all over again...it taught me a lot...if it didn't teach you anything maybe you should've come to lectures and listen...take fessler...he's THE MAN!
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"First, the class itself.  I took LS1 last quarter and decided I wanted to fufill my GE's with the easiest classes possible (at leats for Life Science).  That is what I thought the class would be.  While it is far easier than LS1, it is NOT and easy class.  The material is interesting for a while, but not very applicable to anything unless you want to got into anthropology.  My reccommendation, take this for a LS GE if you do better with short answer than you do multiple choice (his test are ALL short answer) and if you don't really care if you learn something super valuable for the future.  Second, the prof...entertaining, though he gets a little out of control sometimes and talks very fast.  By the lecture notes if they are avaliable but still GO TO LECTURE because they are very incomplete.  Take you notes on the lecture notes because that way you will keep up and be able to write down the important info and not get hung up on the outline concepts.  I would reccommend him, he cares about the students learning and seems to be very passionate about the subject."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"fessler was truly entertaining in class. the way he delivers is lecture and material is very clear and comprehensible.  he tries really hard to get the students to really grasp the material.  he really cared about the students and it really shows whenever you go to talk to him during office hours.  every tuesdays, he would buy four random students lunch!  how awesome is that???  i truly enjoyed fessler's lectures.  not only were they entertaining, but informative also.  i really learned a lot through his lectures.  i would recommend for anyone to take this class.  i really enjoyed it."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Fessler is a really caring professor.  He really wants his students to learn (not just memorize, though there is a lot of that) BUT the class is hard.  There is weekly homework, which requires you to do the readings.  This actually helps a lot because by the end of the quarter you will be glad that you kept up.  The midterm is hard, but as long as you study and keep up with the readings you will do fine.  Be prepared to work hard, but also be prepared to learn a lot of cool stuff!  I recommend him to people who actually want to learn about evolutionary stuff."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"he knows his stuff, he seems really nice and humorous, and is a good lecturer too. however his tests are very hard, he requires you to do a lotta work (up to 100 pages of reading per week, in a very boring book...) and anthropology does get boring many times...however he is a good professor, just that he's hard as well..."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"I completely agree with the person previous!! Professor Fessler is perhaps the best professor I have had at UCLA!! But,I\355m really disappointed with some student\355s comments; the ones who speak negatively about him are the ones who didn\355t do so well; hey, why do you have to take out your aggressions or lack of intelligence on the professor? May it be that it was your fault that the tests were hard (lack of studying)? Also, I honestly believe that this class is doable, the lectures are interesting (most of the time) and the professor sincerely tries to make lectures interesting by his wild antics! He also really cares about student learning, what more can you ask for? Initially, I was afraid of taking this class since its my first year; but, all the first years out there, DO NOT BE AFRAID! You don\355t have to be a south campus major to do well! If you invest enough time and energy, then you well do well! Ok..exams..the midterm was not that bad. The questions were basically completely off his lectures and if you take good notes and are a good memorizer (actually u don\355t even need to memorize that much) you will do well. He\355s basically a prof that focuses on concepts that little details in the book. However, make sure you know the important concepts REALLY well. The final, I have not taken yet (and I will get back to you) but I am assuming that it will be easier than the midterm. Well, that\355s all for right now."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"First, I feel i must avenge Dr.Fessler by saying that the person who posted on Jan 29, 10:48:35, is a raging idiot- we all know it, and I'm sure she must know it; so you can disregard everything that she wrote.  I feel called to do this because Anthro 7 is the most interesting class I have ever taken at UCLA.  Going in merely to fulfill a GE requirement I find the subject completely fascinating.  This is the result of Dr. Fessler's talent and intelligence.  Lectures are always entertaining to anyone with half-a-brain.  Really, who wouldn't love a professor who will randomly start tearing pagaes out of a book and blowing his nose in them to prove a point 15 minutes down the road?  The exams are somewhat difficult due to the large amounts of material covered, yet all the questions are very straightforward.  Best yet, I find myself applying concepts learned in class to different aspects of situations I encounter outside of class, which is the trademark of rewarding studies.  I cannot recommend taking this class enough.  I would like to end by stressing the fact that FESSLER IS A GOD."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"I do not like Dr. Fessler and I wish that I didn't have to take his class AGAIN. He is WAY too concerned with student learning, and makes you do homework every week. I am only taking this class because I have to for my major, and unless you REALLY enjoy hard, boring lectures about anthropology, I don't recommend this class to ANYONE. I don't understand why everyone thinks Dr. Fessler is such a good professor. I think he is one of the WORST professors I have ever had in my 5 years at UCLA. And not only that, but he himself is a very annoying guy. He gives way too much reading, way too much homework, and his tests are way too hard, with no multiple choice questions. If you are looking for an easy class, do not take Anthro 7 with Dr. Fessler. It is not easy, and it is not interesting. Not only that but he TRIES to be funny, and he isn't funny, and his voice sounds like a rat on crack. I can not sit through lecture AWAKE, and I don't even bother to go anymore because there are no seats, the lecture is ALWAYS overly FULL,and it is way too early in the morning. WARNING: DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU ENJOY A LOT OF HARD WORK."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,Fessler is a cool professor.  I loved his Anthro 7 class so much that I'm now pursuing a minor in Anthro.  Highly recommended.  Lee Coltman is a great TA.  As long as you attend lecture and discussion and glance over the book you'll do fine.  The TAs are really helpful with the homework problems.  Go into office hours and if you get the chance do research with him.
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Fiat Lux Freshman Seminars,ANTHRO 19,N/A," Dr. Fessler’s ANTHRO 19 class on animal cognition was pretty cool. We read a book called ""Animals in Translation,"" which revolves around someone’s interpretation on how animals think. The book was interesting but largely unscientific--Dr. Fessler picked up for that in his presentations each week.  He is a brilliant man with a lot to say about biological anthropology. He also has a sense of humor, and he does’t mind going on tangents on topics he finds interesting. Very cool professor and interesting class! Still find myself thinking about the things we learnt. "
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,B+," Good: very interesting class (life changing), questions given before exams to prepare, phenomenal TAs, very cheap textbookBad: 8am, pop quizzes everyday, tremendous study load, could potentially hurt GPA Absolutely life changing class... as another person said this class will totally change the way you view yourself and the world because you learn the ultimate reasons why humans are the way they are; the information you learn in this course is priceless and I think everyone should take this class in general. However, Fessler does not mess around. He gives 1 question pop quizzes right at 8am almost every class (first quiz was the second lecture of week 1), the reading can be very dense and difficult, the study load is absolutely tremendous, and there are many concepts to know. He does give out potential exam questions before the midterm and the final. The knowledge is very interesting and life changing, but truthfully it could semi-hurt your GPA. I worked very hard, read everything, participated in discussion (with Brittnay), went to office hours, was above the curve for the first midterm, and still did not get an A. This was kind of frustrating given how much I was invested in the course and spent a lot of time studying for this class and I loved what I was learning; in the end my answers to the exams mostly were just incomplete. The TAs and Dr. Fessler cannot tell you if your answers to the study guide are incomplete or incorrect. I don't think his lectures  were at all disorganized but what helped me is recording his lecture, then listening back and fill in my notes (best strategy is just to listen and absorb the information). This strategy helps the most because he is very intelligent and that kind of smartness is just too much sometimes at 8am. I don't know what I could have done differently to actually get an A (probably make friends with the smart people in class), but I DEFINITELY don't regret taking the course because I will use the information I learned probably for the rest of my life. ""Knowledge is power, but not over other, but for yourself"" -- Dan Fessler"
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,B,"This class is challenging, especially if you're not naturally good at writing or in-depth papers, don't take this class. You do need some basic background on biology for this class. 2 midterm essays, 1 final, that's it. You need to show up to the discussion. Both midterms are ""75 minutes"" but take about 5-7 hours each. Final requires 12 hours. Wouldn't take it again. However, this class is insanely interesting and very insightful."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,B,"I enjoyed the class overall. The professor talks very fast and goes on many tangents, but our section classes were always helpful in clarifying the key points of the lectures.  The tests were challenging, but as long as you understand the material and do the readings, you will be prepared."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,A,"Okay, this is my favorite class I've ever taken at UCLA. It's SO interesting, I feel like I have such a different perspective on society as a whole. HOWEVER it's very hard. I really like Fessler, though I know some people don't. But be careful on the midterm/final, because they're graded really harshly. Also, your whole grade is basically the midterm and final, but if you get high enough on the final you get an automatic A. Anyway: TAKE THIS CLASS! In conclusion. Thanks."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,A," Real quick note before I delve into my review of this course: it is no longer known as 124P, but 124S. First and foremost, I will come out and say it. This class is NOT easy. I’m sure a lot of students thought the class was going to be a piece of cake given that Fessler provides a study guide which contains the ACTUAL questions that are on the exam. However, the study guide is given to the class about a week or so before the actual exam, which means that one should already be well-versed in the material before the study guide is released. The study guide is LONG and each question has multiple parts. Furthermore, the questions themselves are NOT very straightforward and require deep understanding of the material. The average for the first midterm was about a 55%, which  means people simply waited for the study guide to be posted in order to start studying, and this was a bad mistake.  In order to do well in the class, you have to keep up with the material, which is A LOT. Make sure to record his lectures (he encourages you to do so) and listen to them and write/type down EVERYTHING he says. This is CRITICAL in order to make sure you are able to answer the questions on his study guide.  If you are able to trabnscripbe everything that he says, you will have what you need to answer the questions, and then after that, it’s just going in and doing some hardcore memorizing. I never went to his office hours, but I made sure to visit my TA every chance I got whenever I didn’t understand anything. My suggestion is to join forces with a couple of RELIABLE and COMPETENT students and start a google doc as soon as he posts the study guide questions. Working on the study guide alone is difficult and it’s best to have some help. The midterm and the final are just the select questions from  the study guide, so make sure to memorize ALL of the answers because he picks which questions he will actually put on the exam. The midterm consisted of about 3-4 questions if I recall and the final had about 5-6. Both exams are pretty grueling given that you are under time crunch to write down everything you remember from the answers on the study guide. My hand was literally trembling after the midterm.  Any who, enough with the scary stuff. This class was actually SO FREAKING AWESOME. You will learn so much and it will stick with you. Professor Fessler is pretty darn intimidating because he is so damn articulate and intelligent, but he will make you look at things in such a different way. Even after the class, my friend and I always make connections to the concepts we learned in this class. Highly recommend if you are looking for super duper interesting class and of course, if you’re up for the challenge."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,A-,"This was probably my favorite and most difficult class at UCLA. The workload and concepts taught in the class are tough and you have to put in a lot of effort to succeed, but trust me, it's worth it. I can apply everything I learned in this class in my life and now I have a completely different way of viewing the world. Make sure to form study groups and start going over the study guide together as soon as it's posted. He posts them about a week before the exams and they cover a lot of material. The exams require you to know the material in depth and be able to explain your answers. The average on the midterm was 45% and the final average was a bit higher. Also, get to class on time because there are usually pop quizzes that start on the dot."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,N/A,"Fessler is a very knowledgable professor but his lectures are a bit disorganized -- the readings really help understand the material before class but the 8AM pop quizzes suck.   Go to office hours and stay on top of the reading material.  Midterm is 3 written questions that he chooses from a pool of 10, given beforehand to study.  Final is 6 written questions from 19 questions (the 7 he didn't use for the midterm plus 12 new), also given beforehand to study."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,N/A,"Just a heads up, Professor Fessler posts all of the course evaluations from students on his personal website (danielmtfessler dot com) to help students out. There are a ton more reviews there than here."

Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,N/A," Fessler's class on Human Behavioral Sexuality has been one of my favorite classes at UCLA. He explains the material in a way that is easy to understand, but you should definitely do the readings first before going to class! Not that I always did, but I'd go back afterwards -- the readings are definitely required. One thing I'd suggest, though, is recording lecture! Fessler does not use slides, and most of the information he gives is verbal and easy to miss. Friends or having someone to trade notes with is also good in case you both might have missed something. That's not to say Fessler's boring, though - he can be pretty funny. Before the midterm and the final, he gives you a list of all of the possible questions that will be on the exam. They're very doable as long as you've been caught up with the work. Answers are not simply taken from lecture; you'll need to think through the theories presented in class and apply them logically. Also, the top 15 scorers on the final get an automatic A in case you do badly on the midterm and really strive for that A. On a personal level, I really felt like I began to understand myself in this class. By learning about human behavior, I realized that my attitudes and behavior are, while not necessarily always moral (do not give into the naturalistic fallacy!), well, normal! And you just learn so much about the why humans have come to behave the way they do. So in all, this really was a rewarding class. I am not an Anthropology major or in a biological or psychological (or anything else related) major. But I did get an A+ in this class, so don't let the bad reviews suggesting you have a background in the topic deter you."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,N/A," I thought that Fessler was one of the best professors I've had at UCLA. Although it was annoying to have the quizzes at the beginning of class, I always wanted to go to the lectures. The lecture material was more useful and interesting than the readings, Fessler is a pretty great lecturer. The readings are sometimes very lengthy and boring (at least for me). Also, he gives out the questions for the midterm and final beforehand, what more could you ask for? As far as the class goes, going to lecture and discussion, and then really studying the study guide before the midterm and final should get you the grade you want. Before each test, I would write out the key points for each question so when taking the test, I would be able to answer each question without hesitation. Sometimes the grading can be kind of annoying because the TA's will take off points for really trivial things, so make sure you study everything carefully and accurately. Personally, I scored a B on the midterm, a B- on the final, a low-ish quiz score, and a perfect discussion score. But ended up with a solid A in the class because he gives out A's to the top 15 scorers in the class on the final...I felt so lucky. So Fessler does reward you if you study well for the final. "
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,N/A," As a north campus major (political science), reading these reviews really worried me but I took Fessler's class anyway, and I can honestly say it was my favorite class that I have taken in my four years at UCLA. Also doesn't hurt that I came out with an A. Your grade is going to be based on comprehension. Read: memorization is not going to help you here. So, for you north campus majors, if you think back to high school and had to strain to understand what what going on in biology, this is not the class for you. At the same time, this isn't hard science so a very basic understanding of the logic of biological processes is all you need. Note ""logic"". If you've forgotten all you learned in high school biology but remember it coming pretty easy to you, you should be fine. You don't need to be some fancy premed to do well in this class. Fessler curves, but I can't remember whether he curves at a C+ or a B-. The grade is based on a midterm, a final, quizzes, and section participation. Quizzes are based on the readings. They consist of one question and are given at the beginning of class (as in, if you are 30 seconds late you will miss the quiz). The quizzes do take some thought but if you have done the readings you should get the answers pretty easy. The readings are not very long and they get even shorter as the class goes on, plus they are very interesting. He gives you the midterm and final questions ahead of time, and if you have really been paying attention and understanding the logic of his explanations, they aren't too difficult. The real difficulty of the exams is in being able to write fast enough during the time allotted. That being said, I would highly recommend forming a study group as there are a few question in which he pushes you to think outside of the information given in lecture, and on these questions it is easy to go wrong. In conclusion: high recommended. You don't have to have to be a south campus major but you do have to be capable of processing science-y logic."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,N/A,"I am a third year and I entered the quarter with a 3.94 cumm GPA. I was on time to every single class, took fantastic notes (which I shared with half-a-dozen other class members), read every single assigned reading, took every single quiz, and spent a minimum of 50 hours studying for the final alone (absolutely no exaggeration.) I received a C+ grade in the course. Professor Fessler gives out the questions for the mid-term and final ahead of time. The struggle isn't the answer to these questions though, but rather dissecting between their wordiness and superior vocabulary to identify what the question is actually asking. In retrospect, I almost feel as though he is an intentionally bad test maker to compensate for the fact that he is an absolutely fantastic Professor.It's true- the combination of his ability to accurately assign applicable and interesting readings, his pure genius talent as a lecturer in which he unfailingly gives his students concurrent sore cheeks from laughing and a sore brain from critically thinking upon the commencement of every class period, and his sheer brilliance creates a class in which students actually learn a TON, work very hard, and enjoy it. Yet in his attempt to produce grades that accurately reflect those of other courses (ones which DO NOT posses this rare combination that so effectively teaches) he decides to rain on his masterpiece by creating tests that  measure ones ability to dissemble a puzzling question at the expense of accurately measuring ones knowledge of the actual course material. Hence, students as myself receive an average grade which inaccurately represents our true understanding of the course material. In summary, I have learned SO much that has forever improved who I am and how I see the world insomuch that makes the substandard mark on my transcript worth it. If you are at UCLA to get an education, this is your course. If you are at UCLA to get a degree, RUN! "
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,N/A,"Looking for an experience in anthropology, take this class. Insight on the material is fascinating. Hands out midterm and final questions ahead of time. "
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,N/A,"Hands down the one of the best and most interesting professor in the Anthropology Department. If you need to fulfill your 120 requirement for your Anthro degree, definitely take Fessler, because he makes this class worthwhile. You'll be blown away by the information you learn and it is much more interesting than the other 120 series courses, I should know I've taken them. I made the mistake thinking that the others would be as interesting as this course, but I was wrong, because you need to be interested in a course to do well, and with Fessler's readings and lectures, you'll never be bored considering the classes are early in the morning. Also, he gives you the midterm questions and final questions beforehand. How can you possibly do bad in this class? I had some classmates who came to the midterm and final saying they were just going to ""wing it."" Honestly, I was expecting this class to be torture, but it was a pleasant surprise. Don't miss your opportunity to take this course. It gets better along the way."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,N/A,"Phenomenal professor. If you came here to get an education, this is where you'll get it. The course might SEEM tough, but if you stick it out, you will see the rewards."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,N/A,This was by far the best class i've taken at ucla. every one of his lectures was extremely interesting. He's funny and a nerd. He stands on a table and talks the entire time. rarely uses a projector. The class is based on a midterm and final and a few quizzes he randomly gives out. For both the midterm and final he gives a list of questions the week before and he will ask like 5 of them for the test. so if you memorize all the answers on the sheet you'll do really well. The stuff I learned in this class made me think differently about the way we live. I can't say that for many classes.
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,N/A,"I don't know why people are complaining. This was seriously the EASIEST Class i've taken at UCLA. HE gives you the possible questions for the midterm and final, what more can anyone ask for? If you prepare for the tests you'll do great! Great topic and such an easy A!! Take this class!!!!"
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,N/A,"124P was a challenging class, but it was VERY do-able. The reading is not a lot, but you need to read them, preferably on a consistent basis, rather than cramming it all last minute. He really tells you what you need to know, so in lecture, you should take very complete notes. The material is interesting, and he presents it in an interesting way. If you pay attention during the lecture, you remember a lot of it, even without reviewing your notes. Some complain that the grading on the test is not fair, but I don't think this is true. Let's just say I was 50 minutes late to the midterm (with a little less than 25 minutes to do the rest), and I still got the average score. It's important to take advantage of the fact that he gives you the questions 1 week before the test. Memorize the key points for each question. Find a study group to go over the questions, so that the answers are more complete. Or you can just split up the questions, so that there's less work to do. Then, go over the answers together. The way to get all the points on the test is to make sure you put down relevant details to the question. Don't jump a point in the thought, relate everything to fitness, and it should be fine! I will warn you though, sometimes you're not sure of your answers, which is stressful! Just talk to a couple of others to get their idea on it. Another warning: he is an arrogant person, and it comes across in his lectures. It made it somewhat harder to come to class, but it's fine as long as you focus more on the material. In conclusion, if you want a challenging class that requires thinking, or ""critical thinking"", take the class. If you're honest in your effort (and I don't mean cramming effort!!), then you will enjoy the class!"
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,N/A," Anthro 124P with Fessler is one of the best classes I have ever taken. If your intention is to learn, then definitely take this class, but if you just want to take a class and get a good grade, this class is not for you. A lot of people thought this class was unfair, but that's because you have to really work to get a good grade. It's almost impossible to get an A if you don't actually know the material well and if you aren't a sharp thinker. To get a good grade you also have to have done the readings, shown up to class to take the pop quizzes, participated in section. Basically, you get an A only if you deserve it. If you don't deserve it, as in, you haven't actually fully mastered the material and done all the work, you don't get the grade. It's tough but that sounds a lot more fair to me than the classes where the people who have dedicated time to doing well get the same grade as the people who slack off. This class rewards dedicated, smart students and teaches other people that they have to step up.  The subject matter makes everything in this class interesting and worthwhile. It's not hard to do the readings because they're fascinating, and the information that you learn will really change your perspective on the world if you fully understand it.  Fessler's lectures are extremely interesting and funny, but make sure to take good notes and try to get everything down exactly as he said it. Basically, your pen should never stop moving. A lot of the answers to the exam questions are directly from the notes. The pop quizzes are usually basic questions from the assigned readings--if you've read and you show up, then you'll do fine. There isn't a terribly heavy amount of reading assigned, usually a chapter of the textbook and about 20-25 pages in articles, but do have to get it done. He reviews almost all of the readings in lecture after the quiz. The section assignments are easy, but the exams are difficult and require a lot of preparation. Essay questions are given about a week and a half before the exam and 3 are selected for the midterm, 6 for the final (you don't get to choose which ones to answer). It's really hard to find a good study group because most people don't think critically enough to do well in this class, so I would recommend studying on your own and then making sure to find people who actually know the material and are analytical enough to contribute.  If you like to think, then take it, because even though a lot of people complained about the exams, everyone loved learning about the evolution of human sexuality, and Fessler does a fantastic job teaching the course. "
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,N/A," I took anthro 124P with professor fessler, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! He gave a fair warning on the first day about how this is a ""graduate level class"".. and he was not joking! He gives a grueling amount of readings that are impossible to understand, and then he gives ridiculous quizzes almost every class based on the hardest reading topics. His class is basically a joke. He has a huge ego and is always referring to his own anthro research... the midterm and the final are extremely difficult essay questions which he gives you a week in advanced to look up; however he only chooses a few of the questions and expects rocket-scientist answers! The grading is completely unfair... i really do not recommend this class unless you are a bio or anthro major because fessler expects you to know everything about the discussed topics which is nearly impossible to learn in the span of 10 weeks unless this is your only class!! DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!  And in regards to the positive ratings below, I really think fessler himself submitted those because everyone i know in this class felt the exact same way!!"
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,N/A,BEST CLASS EVER! You learn about really interesting topics and take away so much from this course. If you read and are prepared you will do just fine! TAKE THIS CLASS if u have a chance!!
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,N/A,"Very interesting class, not that much reading, cool professor, tries to crack jokes every now and then. But I would recommend this class for any major, but you are required to critically think, but the information you will learn if worth it, I hope I got a good grade, just could not wait to rate this professor!"
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,N/A,"Genius. Best class I've ever taken. Don't know my grade yet, but honestly, there is no reason to not take this class if you have the chance. Bravo Professor Fessler. "
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,N/A," This was one of my favorite classes, despite the fact that there were mandatory lectures at 8 AM twice a week.  If you have a good background in evolution (EEB 120 is very helpful), then this class will build on the things you already know while delving into some really interesting stuff regarding our sexuality.  I can't really comment on the difficulty of this class for non-bio majors, but it didn't seem too rough.  That said, I should note that Fessler can come off as a jerk sometimes.  He said at the beginning of the course that he was teaching us to ""question what we were being told in our lives"".  Of course, if you question one of his ambiguous quiz questions, you'll get shot down immediately.   The course itself consists mostly of multiple-choice quizzes at the very start of nearly every lecture.  If you're 2 minutes late, you will miss it.  The questions ranged from very easy (you could get them even without doing the reading) to a total crapshoot (even if you had read..).  He curves at the end so it's supposed to even out.  The remainder of the grades come from a midterm and final, both of which you get the questions to beforehand.  Readings consist of journal articles and excerpts from a book.  You can skim them and will usually get all you need out of them, but a few are pretty tough.  I did each reading once, went to every lecture, and reviewed the midterm/final questions for about 2-3 hours the night before and got an A.  You may want to do a bit more if you don't have a strong background in evolution.  Good luck."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,N/A,"All right, here's the breakdown. Anthro 124P was a VERY interesting and informing class. However, this fun topic of great interest to me was easy to learn from Fessler but hard to get a good grade out of. I'm more bio based and ended up with a C+ which I'm not too happy about. Be ware of the TA's, they're very nit-picky when it comes to your answers for the midterm."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,N/A,"This was one of the hardest classes I have ever taken.  The material covered is interesting, but in the lectures, Prof Fessler talks way too fast.  The tests are excruciating & the TA's are very, very hard graders.  If you don't answer the questions with excact wording, even if you get the jist of what the concept is, then you will get an 'F'.  DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS...I recomend Prof. Fiske instead...great teacher, gives great lectures, and his tests are fair."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,N/A,"This professor is one of the most egotistical, self-righteous professors I've ever taken.  His 124P class is all about why he can't get laid.  I have to say it's a very interesting class and you learn a lot, but he prides himself on grading really hard.  Also, he teaches out of a book from the 80's, so it seems he is stuck in a time warp.  He does give updated lectures on current events and studies to try to compensate.  If you are interested in this class for the grade, don't take it.  If you're interested in the topic, take it."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,N/A,"Dr. Fessler is one of the best professors in the Anthropology Department. His lectures are very informative, interesting, and very organized. The articles that we read in class were so engaging that I found myself teaching others about their content. This benefit alone offset the fact that this class was at 8am, had a bunch of unnecessary pop quizzes, and was graded in a way to reduce grade inflation (i.e. this class is not an easy A). I still learned a lot regardless of the grade I earned. If you get a chance, go to his office hours early in the quarter and try to do a research project. He has lots of ideas he is willing to discuss. I didn't do this and  now I regret it. This professor is highly recommended and from me, that says a lot."
Daniel M.T. Fessler,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,A,"This class was incredibly engaging, despite being taught through zoom at 8 am. Not only is the material fascinating, but Dr. Fessler is a great lecturer. Not sure why some of the reviews say the workload was heavy, since the only homework was coming up with two questions from the reading. I guess there were a lot of readings, but they usually were discussed in lecture and weren't too bad. This class is by no means easy, but if you really take an interest in the material, which is really easy to do, then the class will not be so difficult. One of my favorite classes at UCLA!"
Oscar Barragan,NA,Evolutionary Psychology,ANTHRO 124Q,B,"I thought it was interesting that Professor Barragan has his PhD in philosophy, but can fluently teach Ev Psych. He made this class exceptionally understandable through his assigned readings and lectures. EP is an interesting subject which can be complicated (to some) to understand since the foundation of its core elements resides in theory. Yet, professor Barragan made it very understanding and totally made his class engaging. Our grade depended on two exams: midterm and a final which was MCQ. The exams were not difficult if you studied. And he did provide a study guide which was very helpful. Every week he assigned us readings that were academic articles or chapters from books which he provided through the course website. The most we read in one week was like 40 Pages, but most readings were in the range of 15-20 pages. He answered emails promptly and was very open to accommodations. He also used slides. He does lecture a little fast but he is very open to questions. It would be more of an assumption, but I think the majority of the class did well. I would def recommend him for this course."
Abigail Bigham,NA,"Selected Topics in Biological Anthropology: Genes, Disease, and Culture",ANTHRO 129,A,"- Professor Bigham is a very knowledgeable professor and teaches very well. Class is essentially taught on lecture slides, which are useful for both the midterm and final. Professor Bigham knows how to properly explain each topic, and answers questions students have during class very well. The readings we were given which were for discussion section were also interesting to take a look at. - The work in this class consists of submitting a question based on readings, midterm, final, and most importantly a final paper, which is a research paper. There were also a couple of extra credit opportunities given out. - I highly suggest if you take this class that you keep up with the coursework, attend lectures even though they were not mandatory, and study! If you do all of that you should succeed well in this class."
Abigail Bigham,NA,"Selected Topics in Biological Anthropology: Genes, Disease, and Culture",ANTHRO 129,B,"I cannot explain how much I loved this class, but specifically this class taught by Professor Bigham. She is super passionate about the all the topics we went over and definitely super knowledgeable. We moved through a TON of material, but Professor Bigham is extremely organized, which made the material and assignments very doable, and even better: manageable. I will say, this class is not an easy A (I really loved the material, but it is difficult, especially as somebody who is not a STEM major), yet I would take it again just for the pleasure of taking another class with Professor Bigham. My favorite professor yet!"
Erin Debenport,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A,"Professor Debenport is awesome. There is a lot of reading for this class, but her readings are the only readings I have ever been excited to do. She picks them carefully and they have stuck with me for years (I cited one in another final paper). I truly enjoyed this class, enough to go out of my way to take another class from her.  She is fair, honest, funny, and interesting!"
Erin Debenport,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"This class is easy if you put in the work. Debenport is young, knowledgeable, and passionate, but she is not super experienced as a lecturer. She required that all students put away their phones (mind that we had lectures in Fowler’s large lecture hall) and multiple times throughout the quarter she called people out for whispering during class. As a non-anthro/ling major, I found the material to be a bit tedious. There is a small book required that was only semi-helpful."
Erin Debenport,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"Selling ""Living Language""(the textbook) at $15! Text 424-522-3141 Professor Debenport is really approachable, easygoing, and professional. Her class is super clear and the study guide she gives guarantees your A+ in the class. As long as you do the reading, attend the lecture, and prepare well with the study guide, you'll get an A+. Topics are pretty interesting, not hard at all. Some readings can be intriguing, but she'll explain and highlight the important points during the lecture so technically you can skip one or two and still get away with it. Really great Professor -- open-minded, lovely, and passionate about her works! Please buy my book, price definitely negotiable! I've taken this class two years ago and yet I've been carrying this heavy textbook all the time..."
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A+,"Prof. Cattelino is an amazing professor! I took this class because it was a pre-req for my major but afterwards, I enjoyed it so much that I decided to pick up an anthropology minor! She is extremely understanding of these ""unprecedented times"" and allowed students who missed quizzes (for whatever reasons) to make them up often, and she even gave everyone a 5% grade boost at the end of the quarter because she knows this was a rough few months for everyone. The readings are a lot of work and very time-consuming, so if you don't want to dedicate a lot of time to this class, maybe don't take it- but I found the readings super interesting. The essays may seem very daunting and vague at first, but my TA was extremely helpful and broke down the prompt/how to write an anthropology paper in section. I think the grade breakdown was 25% for both midterm and final papers, 30% for weekly quizzes (lowest dropped), and 20% for participation during section. Highly recommend this class!"
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A,"Professor Cattelino is very kind, considerate, and accommodating. The only assignments were weekly low-stakes quizzes (super easy as long as you pay attention to the lectures) which consisted of multiple choice questions and one short-response question (which may or may not rely on the readings for the week) and two term papers which were a little challenging to start, but the professor and TAs were very helpful and gave lots of feedback on how to write them. As someone who is not a social science major, I found this class to be an overwhelming amount of reading, but were usually thought provoking and interesting. In addition to the required texts for the course, a VPN is required for most readings. I would say the actual content of the course isn't difficult but the reading is dense."
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A,"Prof. Cattelino was amazing. Her lectures are very clear and interesting. Plus, she was very understanding of  her students situations due to the pandemic and was open to extending deadlines for students who needed it. The weekly quizzes were not difficult and were great to just make sure you were absorbing the material in the lectures (almost all answers were literally in the lectures themselves). While the readings could be a little daunting, they were actually very interesting. I would 100% recommend anyone take this class."
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A,An easy and interesting class if you do the readings and attend discussion actively. Professor Cattelino is so nice and very accommodating about classes being over zoom. Lectures were all recorded and quizzes were taken over a 12 hour time frame and open note. The two essays were not that much work and there were opportunities for extra credit.
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A,"Professor Cattelino is an amazing professor. Her lectures were extremely engaging, and I really enjoying learning about the different topics within the class. Additionally, she was super considerate of her students in the midst of the pandemic, from extending deadlines when needed to offering extra credit to help cushion our grades. The readings were pretty lengthy, and I didn't end up reading all of them, but I still felt pretty okay with the content as long as I watched the lectures. The discussions help immensely with learning the material, so I'd suggest going (and have at least 3-4 points ready to add). The weekly quizzes were really easy, the answers were in the lectures for the most part.  I don't think the papers were too bad, I think as long as you keep up with the class lectures and familiarize yourself with 2 readings, you'll do good."
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A,"I took this class in my first quarter as a transfer and it was a great class. It was alot of work more than my two upper div classes but it is 5 units so makes sense. The professor was super understanding of difficulties what with being online and all the circumstances that came with it. I didn't always do the reading fully or I would skim it and make sure I had something I could add to the discussion sections. Go to section, it brought a lot of understanding to the readings, if I didn't really do the reading that week, I would make sure I took notes during section and those really helped when it came time ot write papers. There were only two papers total and weekly quizzes. Would 100% recommend great class, professor, and TAs."
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,B+,"The essays for this class were pretty difficult. They require a lot of analysis and social interpretation, and your grade heavily depends on how strict your TA is. If you are good at reading between the lines and developing complex ideas and arguments, this class is for you. If you are looking for an easy GE like I did, don't take this class."
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A-,"This class material and Professor Cattelino's lectures are quite engaging. I enjoyed the assigned readings, which is why I didn't mind the depth and overall length of them. If you do not enjoy this material, however, you WILL struggle. The weekly assigned readings have to be understood quite well because participation in the discussion sessions are graded and the essays are graded a little harshly depending on the TA."
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,B+,"Do not take this class for a GE unless there is really nothing better open. Save ur social analysis for a different quarter. The readings can be interesting but honestly, the essays are really difficult to grasp. I consistently got a low B on the essays and a C on the midterm. Even with a 96 in the class and 100% participation, I ended up with a B+. It was an annoying class, worst grade so far at UCLA."
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A-,"This review may be biased, as I was not a fan of anthropology as a subject, but I found Professor Cattelino's lectures to be a bit dry and my TA really screwed me as far as grading goes. The readings aren't really necessary, except for the ones you have to cover in your essays, and the midterm and final are super easy if you attend lecture and take notes."
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,C+,"Do not take this class. Not only is it extremely boring, but the TA actually screwed my grade. The class is 2 essays, a midterm, a final and participation in discussion. Both of my essays were handed back to me with 0 marks from my TA on the essay and the rubric as she gave me a 70. When I asked why I got that grade she had no reasons. The TA makes a huge impact in your grade and for the amount of weekly readings you are required to do, the class is simply not worth it. Just honestly, don't take the class."
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A-,"This class was very interesting and Prof Cattelino gave very engaging lectures. This class included two papers and the midterm (50 multiple choice) and final (Multiple choice and short and long answer questions) as well as a lot of reading assignments in between that. This class had long assigned readings and many. These readings were pretty much the basis of the class and you needed to know them well for the tests and papers. Cattelino's slides were very descriptive and if you missed a lecture you could usually easily catch up with the posted slides. It was just very important to stay on top of the readings and attend lecture and discussion. If you do this you can do really well on the papers and tests, especially the tests because they are very straight forward on asking about the readings and concepts learned in lectures."
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,B," Hands down the worst anthro class I've taken at UCLA to date. It's not really Professor Cattelino's fault, but the material is mind-numbingly boring, mostly because it all seemed like common sense, but to be fair I've studied sociocultural anthro a lot before, and my TA (Bianca Romagnoli) was incredibly incompetent. I had students coming to me for help instead of the TA because of how unapproachable and unclear she was because it was mostly freshman and I'm a junior. Not only that, I walked out of every discussion section more confused than I walked in. She clearly had no idea what the readings were saying because she just listed off what the professor had said and had no response to most of our questions. There are two papers (40% in total), a midterm (20%) and a final (25%), plus participation grade (15%). But don't think you can know the material and get a good grade. I've gotten As in graduate-level sociocultural anthro courses and still ended up with a B in the class because of my TA. I emailed her like 10 times and received a response twice. The only reason I got a B is because I literally aced the midterm and final, and because my professor slightly boosted the grade of one of my papers. The saddest part is, I brought my paper to a different TA (because mine refused to ever answer my emails) and was told it looked fine, so simply having a different TA would've entirely altered my grade. Long story short, the material isn't particularly interesting, your grade isn't based on mastery of course material but rather the whims of your TA, and despite how kind and approachable Professor Cattelino is, the size of the class makes it impossible to create a meaningful connection with her as a professor. I highly recommend NOT taking this class as a GE, and if you have to for major/minor requirements, be very very wary of your TA and good luck. Coming back 2 years later just to be extra sure to give a huge shout out to Bianca Romagnoli for being the worst TA, no actually make that educator in general, I have ever had the displeasure of being in a classroom with. Not only was she unprofessional, unhelpful, and uninterested, but she decided that since she was from Canada she was well within her rights to grade all our papers on a Canadian scale (ie 70s for a B). I held back in my original review wondering if maybe I overreacted to how legitimately terrible she was, but after 4 years at UCLA and 16 years in schooling in general, I can honestly say she is the most awful teacher I have ever come across. I’ve had bad TAs before, but all understandably so & eager to get better and just learning the position, none so absolutely terrible & closed off to suggestions or offering any help that I’ve constantly thought back every quarter to how inept they were. It’s two years later and I still wince every time I think back to those discussions. I don’t know if she’ll ever TA this course again but if you come across this review and see her as a TA for a different course AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A-,"Her lectures were a bit boring at times but you'll learn important concepts that are applicable to every day life. Would definitely recommend this class. There are readings due each week that you'll go over in section (mandatory) and it's a bit difficult to keep up with it at times. Homework-wise however, you only have to write one reading question based on one of the readings and it's pretty easy to BS it if you need to. Her exams are based off her lectures and general concepts in the readings.There are also two essays (and for each there are two prompts that you can choose from): one where you tie in a reading with other articles/songs and another where you have to engage in your own ethnographic fieldwork. Get help from the undergraduate writing center!"
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,B,"First class I took at UCLA. Tons of reading. Although it is really interesting, it is so much and you have to read it because you discuss it in discussion (that are mandatory). Subject area is super interesting. Half of the class is about old civilizations and the second half is all modern. No text book, but articles and books about different people groups. Two essays that are graded pretty hard and a midterm and final that has multiple choice and short answer. A lot of information to grasp and she makes you think in a way that I was not used to. Interesting class, but would not take if you are looking for an easy GE."
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,B+,"Cattelino is such an interesting and respectful lady. I had 0 interest in anthro at the beginning of the year, yet I went to every lecture because she was so soothing and interesting to listen to. The essays are easy, just go to the writing center for help. I would have earned a better grade had it not been my first quarter at UCLA and I knew how to get help on writing. The final was insanely easy, and weekly question responses are due on CCLE but it's really not a lot of work. Highly recommend this class."
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,A," The class was interesting in terms of the topics covered; Reading can get a bit tedious and builds up, but she tests on them, so go to discussion to get a rough summary of the readings and take down the main points. There are two essays, none of which are extremely difficult, but they do require you to get a solid understanding of the topics covered in class and/or the readings. I especially enjoy the field studies essays since I got some more freedom in what I write based on what I observed.  She doesn't take attendance, but she doesn't podcast her lectures, so the only way to actually understand her slides is to attend lecture, though her lectures don't always make sense either, since she ends up just posing a lot of questions that went unanswered.  Tests weren't difficult, but require some memorization - other than that, this is a fairly interesting class. I wouldn't mind taking another class with her again."
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,A-,"This class was honestly just fine. Cattelino is really sweet, as mentioned below, but I was always distracted in lectures and bored, since the slides were dull and didn't contain info. the readings were interesting but VERY long and a huge workload, so it was tough to keep up. I was never excited to go to this class, and while I feel i did learn some valuable things, it is not a class i would jump to take again"
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A," I took this class as a GE and thoroughly enjoyed this class. Prof. Cattelino is one of the best professors I've ever had; she is sweet, really concerned about students' learning, and really  passionate about anthro (she tries to make it as interesting and relevant to students as she can). Grades are based on: Participation (15%)Midterm - all multiple choice (20%)Essay #1- 4 pages (20%)Essay #2- 4 page fieldwork paper (20%)Final Exam- multiple choice, 2 short answers, 1 essay question (25%) There is so much reading assigned throughout the quarter and I wasn't able to do most of it. But luckily, her exams test on how well you know your concepts and how well you can apply them. The exams were relatively easy even without doing all the readings. But that's not to say that you can get a good grade without putting in work and ignoring the readings. Skim the readings, know the concepts well, go to lecture (take good notes especially on the examples she gives), know the big ideas in each of the reading, and pay attention in discussion.  The essays are a different story. The first essay wasn't too bad, but the fieldwork paper prompt was difficult because the prompt was confusing and less concrete than the first prompt. Go to your TA for help! I would say that going to lecture is a huge part of doing well in the class. She's an awesome lecturer- she clearly explains concepts and also keeps it engaging and relevant by relating the concepts to current events. This class is definitely not your easy A GE, but it helped me looked at the world in a different way and also gave me a new appreciation for anthro."
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"i kind of hated this class. the work load was a bit too much for a GE. professor Cattelino is nice but her lectures are long and boring. she assigned too many readings, and you have to read them because the whole class is based on them.  the midterm was pretty easy and multiple choice but i did not like the essays (there were 2) because the TAs were hard graders. overall this wasn't the worst class but definitely not worth all the effort and it is not as interesting as I thought it would be. 4/10 probably would not recommend"
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,B+,"Professor Cattelino is a great professor. However this class had a tougher workload than expected and a lot of my fellow classmates agreed with that. Past that the class was an overall enjoyable experience and I felt like this class actually mattered to professor Cattelino even though it was just a GE. Usually GEs aren't high on the professor's list. The essays are graded moderately, don't expect to get an A if you don't work rather hard on them. There is a lot of reading, my TA commented that professor cattelino goes through the readings and changes them each quarter so while it is a lot she cares about what she's teaching us and wants it to something that is relevant to us. The exams weren't too tough they were fair. Review the readings and notes, the concepts are really important. I loved Lives in Limbo, it was a great book and I loved a Latino relevant book being used at UCLA  in a non-chicano studies class. Overall if you don't mind a rather heavy workload then take this class, I think it was worth it. I might not have gotten the grade I wanted but I actually really enjoyed a GE for once."

Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,B+,"Professor Cattelino was super nice and always willing to help. The class material was pretty interesting and the books were all weird (but fun) reads. She also showed lots of videos and stuff in class that complemented the class well. The papers were graded kind of tough but that was more the TAs then her. Overall, a solid class."
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"Dr. Cattelino is amazing! I loved her class. She is a great lecturer, and the class is very interesting. If you are looking for an interesting GE than you have found your class! This class helped me to look at the world differently and though the reading can be a bit intense at times, the class is totally worth the effort and Dr. Cattelino never fails to make lectures awesome."

Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"Cattelino is a good professor compared to most GE professors. She is very nice and willing to help. The class is pretty straightforward and easy... exams were easy and I scored As on them without much work. The essays were the most difficult part... talk to your TAs about your ideas beforehand to make sure you are on the right track. Overall, a good, interesting, and fairly easy course."
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A," Professor Cattelino is a decent professor.I wouldn't say she is fantastic like the other evaluation says, but she is better than most GE professors around...-pretty clear and concise-willing to help you understand topics-tries to keep the information we learn relative  The thing I really loved about the class was that she posts her lectures online, although to really understand what shes talking about you need to go to class, but it's easy to get a general knowledge. Definitely do the readings though, and last thingI honestly think that a HUGE portion your grade depends on the TAs. Two papers and one final (one paper is a ""field"" paper which sucks but whatever). "
Jessica Cattelino,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"Professor Cattelino is fantastic. She teaches in a conversational style, often bringing in relevant modern day examples to supplement concepts that she's teaching in class. I took Anthro 9 as a GE. It was relatively easy and I'm not considering minoring in Anthro. Definitely recommend her as a professor. I also went to office hours one time just to talk; she's extremely friendly and welcoming. "
Jeffrey Snyder,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A+,"The summer 2020 version of this class was asynchronous, which I thought was a good way to take it since we could work at our own pace. There were no big tests (midterms/finals), just a quiz or two on each module we went through. The quizzes are definitely based on the videos/reading, and they often mention specific examples found in the textbook or points he made in the video, so look out for that. Overall, the quizzes were pretty straightforward and the professor was responsive and helpful."
Jeffrey Snyder,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A," Professor Snyder is a fun guy and is very passionate about what he is teaching, so his lessons are quite engaging. However, if you're too lazy to get up for class, he posts all of his powerpoint slides on CCLE and the TAs will go through the more important concepts during section too, so it's alright to not go for lecture. I missed almost half of his lecture and still got an A. The test is not tricky, but can be hard if you can't memorize. Professor Snyder will also moderate if the average is too low (e.g. on the second midterm, he gave everybody ten extra marks to pull up the average). He's a really fair professor. The TAs also grade by effort, not by how correct your answers are, so that was very stress-relieving for me. Overall, if you're looking for an easy science GE to take, I would definitely recommend this. I liked the class material especially the part about race (except when it reached hominids) and I definitely find this a more interesting option compared to other science GE classes."
Jeffrey Snyder,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A," Professor Snyder has created a very interesting introductory class to human evolution. I learned so much in this class and still remember everything he taught a year later.  It is easy to do well in this class as long as you go to lecture and pay attention. As in most classes, you get out what you put in so it's important you do the work. Definitely read the textbook! He uses it for test questions!"
Jeffrey Snyder,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"This class has a ridiculous grading scale that takes the focus away from mastering material and makes the goal of the class memorizing verbatim the words of the professor. With all the exams the points were distributed not based on content but based on word choice and presentation. I learned nothing from this course other than standard points that on the exam i received average credit for. Multiple choice questions are confusing and unclear. Though his lectures are well prepared and presented, due to the grading system of the course it is hard to appreciate the work of the professor."
Jeffrey Snyder,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,selling How Humans Evolved 6th edition $35
Jeffrey Snyder,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A," Dr. Snyder’s ANTHRO 7 on human evolution is a cool class. We go over the driving forces of evolution, then talk about human evolution, and finally talk about some of the ramifications of the topics, such as for mate selection and race.  Most people consider the class an easy A if you do the work, which there is little of. The information is all in the lectures (or if you prefer, the book) and there is a small weekly assignment on some review problems in the text (and the answers are all online). The exams are a bit of do or die, though. There are only a few questions on the midterms, so if you lose a few points your score goes down by a lot. The questions aren’t hard or tricky though—straight from the lectures and assignments. The final was long, with a bunch of free response questions. Based on the distributions for the tests, I think only about 50 of 200+ people ended up getting an A in this class. I seriously don’t understand why it would be that low.  For me, the class was too easy and not that engaging. This is college, so I think we could have handled going more in depth about human anatomy and the different hominid species. (There's some good stuff of Coursera or edX if you're also interested.) Not that many people would show up to the lecture because you could get by without it.  Dr. Snyder himself is a cool guy. He makes himself clear and is friendly. He even has a sense of humor. As for my TA, Mr. Justin Myrick was awesome. Smart and fun! "
Jeffrey Snyder,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A," I took this class fall quarter, so I don't know if the grading method changed for winter quarter. Pretty much, if you want to do well, look over the study guides and make lists. Memorize the lists. If the study guide tells you that you should know the evidence for meat-eating, make a list of the evidence for meat-eating (cut marks on bone, vitamin A poisoning, etc.). It's pretty easy to get 100% on the exams if you memorized the right stuff. But that also means it's easy to get a C on an exam if you don't lol. Regardless, the material's interesting and the textbook is very easy to read. Overall, the class was very fun and the professor's cool. Use the study guides to prepare well for the exams and you'll do fine."
Jeffrey Snyder,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"He was a cool guy and the class was interesting, but it had the most capricious and just stupid grading system I've ever seen. Even if you know every single answer on the tests you'll get points off because the rubric for each question is super random. It doesn't test your understanding, it just asks you to regurgitate facts. But even if you regurgitate the facts 100% accurately you'll get points off for no reason."
Jeffrey Snyder,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Hmm. This class could have been hard, but, for some reason, it seems intentionally not. The exams are easy. Really easy, but then you can get points off for not using exactly the right term for which they were looking. Kinda lame. They should really just make the tests harder and stop being so nit-picky about us using absolutely the precise terms. That method just makes people memorize bullet points instead of actually learning about the material.Another thing about this class is that the professor seemed really thrown any time anyone asked a question to the point where people just stopped asking questions. I don't get that. Since his lectures were just reading the PP slides and the PP slides were directly out of the book, what are we doing in there if we can't ask questions? Couldn't we just read the book and not bother with the class at all?Anyway, if you're going to take this class, just look at his ""exam study guides"" and search for all the prompts in the PP slides. AND MEMORIZE THEM. Lame, but true."
Jeffrey Snyder,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,A,"Professor Snyder is great. He is incredibly knowledgeable, clear, and concise. I am just about to finish this class for Summer Session A, so it moves very very fast, and there is a LOT to learn. That being said, he is one of the more organized and no-nonsense professors I've ever had. We didn't have actual zoom lectures so there was no face to face contact, but he is still very helpful and receptive to questions. As long as you do all of the readings and pay close attention (take notes!!) to his lecture slides, you will do well in the class and learn a lot. The class is extremely interesting, and he presents all information in a way that is easy to understand. He works very hard to make sure he is impartial and his sources unbiased. 10/10, probably my favorite professor yet!"
Jeffrey Snyder,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,A,So long as you do the readings and thoroughly complete the study guides for the midterm and final-you should be set. Make sure to do all the readings because he frequently gives pop-quizzes. He posts all his lecture slides and is pretty approachable. Do the work and you should be fine!
Jeffrey Snyder,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,A,"Professor Snyder was extremely knowledgeable and passionate about this subject material which made it easy to stay engaged. He was also SOOOO clear with his slides, like everything on the slides the was useful- and of course he posts those on CCLE. This was the first 8 am that I went to every week without fail because going was always worth it. Snyder's tests were all short answer, where he would give you 6 possible questions for the study and then choose 3 randomly for the midterm, the final was the same format except he chose 6 questions from 12. The tests were not difficult if you studied- I literally studied one day before the tests and I got an A. I highly  recommend this class as it has super interesting material, a great professor, and fair tests."
Jeffrey Snyder,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,B,"This is an exceptional course and you will learn a lot. He provides slides and his lectures are clear, concise, and engaging. Attendance is in your best interest if you want to pass the exams (midterm is worth 35% and the final is worth 45% of your grade). Both exams consist of short answer / essay questions. He provides a study guide, but as mentioned by others you need to complete it yourself. No textbooks but you will read research articles pertinent to the course that he assigns online. He is very helpful and approachable if you have questions."
Jeffrey Snyder,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,B-,"This class is well planned and the slides are like gold all the answers you need are there. There are study guides for the exams which you MUST complete ALONE. The tests are hard because he looks for very specific terminology in your answers, these terms are used in the slides and you must remember them. I learned a lot from this class and enjoyed the lectures.  the class is graded 10% pop quiz scores, 40% midterm, 50% final."
Jeffrey Snyder,NA,Evolution of Human Sexual Behavior,ANTHRO 124S,A,"Dr. Snyder is very knowledgeable in this field. He takes great lengths to explain concepts so they are understandable and does everything he can to make this class an inclusive one. He performs in class quizzes with the iClicker and the exams are given ahead of time so you can prepare. if you pay attention and read the required documents, you will get a great education and a good grade."
Thomas Wake,NA,Selected Laboratory Topics in Archaeology,ANTHRO C117,A,"Wake is the coolest professor ever.  He assigns a ton of reading and his exams can be a lot of writing, but it's totally doable. First or second week of class, Wake busts out a bunch of frozen deer legs on the table for students to deflesh for their final projects. Using your hands to make tools or ornaments using the same technology as our ancestors was such a fun and immersive process. I highly recommend taking a class with Dr. Wake if you are at all interested in lithics."
Thomas Wake,NA,Selected Laboratory Topics in Archaeology,ANTHRO 117P,A,"Professor Wake is one of the most amazing professors at UCLA. I've taken all of his courses, and they were a bit difficult to handle at first. The professor, however, does an excellent job of helping you along the way. Since this is a selected topics course, there are no more than 15 people in the class. Therefore, the professor gets very involved with his students. This is a hands-on learning experience that beats any lecture. I have learned more from his selected topics courses than any other Anthropology lectures. His tests are a little difficult, but if you are attending all the lectures and keeping up with the readings then you are in solid shape of getting a good grade. Dr. Wake is a brilliant man, and a gem to the Anthropology/Cotsen Archaeology department!"
Thomas Wake,NA,Selected Topics in Archaeology,ANTHRO 119,A-,"This was a excellent course on the archaeology of Lower Central America. It covers the archaeology of Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama. It starts from the middle Pleistocene and ends at around 1500 A.D. It also covers topics such as paleo-Indian lithic technology and subsistence, and includes various culture areas and early material culture. Just keep in mind this course does not cover Mayan archaeology! Your grade consist of five quizzes, a midterm, and final exam. All quizzes were short written answers identifying material culture or identifying geographic points on a map. The midterm and final consisted of 20 questions each. Some questions on the exams were mix and match, others were short and long essay answers. To be honest the exams were not difficult if you did the readings and went to lecture. Plus he did provide study guides! Just keep in mind that he does assign a ton of reading the first 5 weeks. At times I became frustrated because we had over 100 pages of reading a week before midterms, ugh. It was tough for me because I had to grind while taking 4 courses this quarter; but it’s totally doable if you’re taking 3 classes. Also, Dr. Wake only answered 1 out of 3 emails I sent him and he didn’t give us our midterm grades until week 10! The latter due to some administrative departmental issues with acquiring a grader for our exams. I’m sure that’s not his usual grading routine, but nonetheless nerve racking. Other than that he was a excellent professor that is very insightful about archaeology and I would definitely recommend this class!"
Thomas Wake,NA,Selected Topics in Archaeology,ANTHRO 119,A," Archaeology of Lower Central America This class was fun and easy. Every week he gave a 10pt quiz, but often times the quiz was just signing in to make sure you were there.You have to memorize a lot of geography and dates and things — tests are memorization based. But I found that pretty doable.The grade is based on those quizzes, midterm, final and a final research paper on a topic of your choice.Professor Wake has a sort of dry humor I enjoyed and he’s really great in his field, I liked hearing about his experiences in Central America.Overall I recommend."
Thomas Wake,NA,Selected Topics in Archaeology,ANTHRO 119,A-,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF EXTINCTION 118Honestly, I love Dr. Wake as a person. His stories and anecdotes are great and he is definitely passionate about his field of study, but I would NOT recommend his course unless you are a fan of taxonomy and geography. There are map quizzes and taxon quizzes, which really have nothing to do with the lectures. You are expected to anticipate the Genus and Species names that will be on the quizzes as well as the countries, not from a study guide or lectures, but from the readings. Though I went to his office hours and asked for pointers repeatedly, he was not willing to give any direction at all. That being said, the study guide for the midterm was very helpful and so was the one for the final. I think Dr. Wake is a great professor, but he is not willing to go above and beyond for his students like some other professors I've had at UCLA. He only offered extra credit after the class repeatedly begged for it because most people got low scores on the quizzes, around 40-50%. Going to class and keeping up with the readings is essential."
Thomas Wake,NA,Selected Topics in Archaeology,ANTHRO 119,B,"ARCH OF EXTINCTION - You will be memorizing over 150 scientific species names and the location of multiple countries, ecosystems, and other important places. You won't have a lot of notice for what to focus on.  It's a lot of work for one class.  If you have any interest in zooarchaeology, the megafauna of the Pleistocene, animal conservation, etc... you will be able to make this class interesting for yourself with some effort. It's just a lot of material, and he isn't the most accessible professor. He never answered emails from me or my classmates. He is very helpful in office hours though.  He also does offer extra credit and he does give study guides, which is great!"
Teruko Vida Mitsuhara,NA,Ethnography of Everyday Speech,ANTHRO 151,N/A,"Engaging professor and interesting material, no required textbook and she gives all the readings as pdfs for free online. This class is heavily dependent on a group project component. Pick your group carefully as 70% of your grade depends on your group work. Prof. is young and has a lot of passion but isn't necessarily approachable and is quick to criticize if you disagree with her or misunderstand lecture material. Office hours are super early in the morning too which sucks for students who don't like waking up so early (class was at 9am, OH from 8-9). I would probably not take a class with her again because the lecture material became really repetitive and boring in the second half. Good news is there was no midterm or final exam, just one theory quiz around week 7."
Barney A. Schlinger,NA,Hormones and Behavior in Humans and Other Animals,PHYSCI M140,A,"I had high expectations going into this class, and although I was not disappointed, it was just okay. There is two non-cumulative tests, a midterm and final in class. There is also an essay on a behavior and hormone of your choice, although the instructions are not the clearest. The tests were often harder than they had to be, even though the material was not too in depth."
Min Li,NA,Chinese Civilization,CHIN 50,A,"The class is mind-blowing and easy A at the same time. If you are interested in Chinese history, definitely take it. The prof is very passionate and taught clearly, I really like him!"
Min Li,NA,Chinese Civilization,CHIN 50,A+," ***You can find more reviews for this class if you look up ""Li Min!""  That is the Chinese arrangement of his first name and surname!  I took this class remotely, so I can't say how it is normally. With that said, it's not a free A. I wouldn't consider it an easy GE. The majority of the class (including myself) was confused as to what was happening for much of the quarter. I think the only reason this class was alright for me is because I had a pretty good understanding of Chinese history beforehand. Grades were based on a scores from 4 pop quizzes, a presentation, discussion participation, a midterm, a final exam, and a final paper. We didn't have any other assignments, so this really is one of those classes that relies on just a few assignments. As for the professor, his lectures didn't feel useful. He's an archeologist, and the first half of his lectures reflect that quite a bit. Lectures felt pretty unorganized, so after the midterm, I honestly just stopped watching the lectures and relied on the textbook instead. PLEASE GET ACCESS TO A TEXTBOOK IF YOU CAN!! It's probably the only reason I got the grade I did. For the final paper, I'd 100% recommend asking your TA for feedback before you submit. It helps you know exactly what they're expecting, which was important since we didn't get a rubric or anything. Final paper was 20% of our grade. Other than that, just be sure to put effort into your presentation and try to talk during discussions."
Min Li,NA,Chinese Civilization,CHIN 50,A,"It’s not a free A. It’s a history class so u do have to memorize a lot of stuff. But he provided study guides for tests, so it’s definitely easier."
Min Li,NA,Selected Topics in Archaeology of China,ANTHRO 116Q,A,"As a person, nice and accommodating. As a professor, not the worst but not particularly engaging. Participation is mandatory on the syllabus but he doesn't take attendance. Personally, I found the lectures boring and he tends to ramble a lot. Open book tests, 1 literature review, and a 10-page final paper. You can pass the class if you just use his textbook, which he provides for free."
Luke Yarbrough,NA,Making and Studying Modern Middle East,M E STD M50CW,A,"Professor Yarbrough's class, was, albeit chaotic and a decent amount of work, a really rewarding class where I got to learn a lot about the Middle East (MENA) region and was able to workshop my writing skills. This class was definitely a mixed bag for me, lets start with the negatives. Prof assigns A LOT of readings, while this is to be expected from a writing II course, at times it can get out of hand. Week 2 he assigned us an entire 150+ page novel to read by his thursday lecture in addition to several other 15 page articles. Much of this reading is quite interesting and non-academic, but it is still a lot of work to get through. There are also quite a lot of films assigned, but I actually had a good time watching most of them. To be completely honest you can get away with skimming or even not reading a lot of the assigned readings as long as you pay attention to lecture and listen to your TA during section( thats what I ended up doing). The other negative is the amount of work required for the class, not only are there the two major papers for the quarter, there are also weekly reading checks that are 2 pages long, and a seperate midterm and final. To make matters worse the essay prompts, especially essay 2, were suuuper long and convaluted, the prompt for the second essay was a big paragraph, and to be honest after submitting my essay, I still dont really know what the prompt was. Okay, now onto the positives. The prof is incredibly enthusiastic about the course material, he is always really excited and makes the lecture experience so much more interesting. Usually I fall asleep during lectures, but I always enjoyed his and couldnt wait for them each week. After an essay submission he gave us a ""pizza party"" esque day where we watched a fun film and got to try a bunch of middle eastern food which was insanely fun. The TA is also a lifesaver in the course, I got lucky and got a great one who helped me workshop my essays and fix them when they needed help. She gave so much feedback on it and helped me improve it, and my writing skills in general a ton which I really appreciate. Finally, the prof offers 2% extra credit for two short 1 page responses to films which I would definitely recommend, as it is a little work for such a large grade bump. Overall I would definitely recommend this course because of the great professor and interesting material, but be prepared for a lot of reading and writing."
Luke Yarbrough,NA,Making and Studying Modern Middle East,ANTHRO M67W,A," I took this class for a GE / Writing II credit. If you are in the same position, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!Also as a disclaimer, I am getting an A, so I'm not salty about grades, this class is just a HUGE time commitment for what a GE should be... I am a neuro major and am used to putting in a good amount of work for my classes, but this class was sucking up more time than all my actual major classes combined!I had to take it and stay in it because I was a graduating senior, otherwise I would honestly have dropped within the first couple weeks and waited to take a lighter GE.  GRADING:Attendance of discussion (not required for lecture): 10%Participation	in discussion: 10%Response papers /Focus Question Answers (300-500 words per week): 10%Midterm Exam: 15%Final Exam: 15%Essay 1, 7 pages (draft=5%, revision=10%): 15%Essay 2, 9 pages (draft=10%, revision=15%): 25% CLASS: Two 1h15 lectures a week (that thankfully are recorded). Slides are about 50 per lecture with nothing but pictures in them and random words... so be prepared to take the fastest notes of your life or watch the recordings slowly to catch all the details -> because the exams will ask about detailed information the professor says in lecture.He is honestly a nice man and good lecturer, I'd love to listen to him as a podcast, but hated having to actually absorb every single detail he mentioned in class for the exams... he could at least add some more text to slides so you can focus on listening instead of writing all the small details... or make the exams be less into the details. The level of detail honestly makes it seem like you're a graduate anthro student instead of an undergraduate GE student... DISCUSSIONS (1h per week): if you can, have Emma as your TA, she was the one blessing in this class! Every week you must show up and participate a little bit for points, and then you also need to turn in a weekly focus question (300-500 words) based on a question from the readings. It took me about 1h a week to do the focus question (not counting the time to do the readings!) Readings: they are the reason this class is ridiculous. I could deal with the detailed lecture aspect... but the amount of readings required for this class is absurd. There were weeks where we'd have to do 100+ pages of readings, watch a 1-2h movie, and read an 30 min-1h article! IN ONE WEEK! I'd spend easily 4-5h a week on the materials... and I wouldn't read the actual novels, I'd either skim or read many notes and articles about them... because I cannot read a freaking book a week for ONE class... and also because you had to pay for them a lot of the times which seems ridiculous to me when there's so many good, free and shorter reading sources he could've picked instead the problem is that you need the readings to both answer the focus question each week, as well as for the exams! If you don't do them you will most likely fail the class, which is what makes it such an impossible time commitment. The articles were normally a good read, some shorter videos we're good too. The problem really is with having whole damn novels some weeks... if the professor cut it down to 1-2h a week of extra material it would be much more reasonable. Exams: 50 questions each, non cumulative, open note. Half the exams are on the lecture and the other half is on the readings. He will go into detail. It is not enough to know the symbolisms or meanings in each reading, he will ask you for specific information about them. I missed an exam question on a reading that I had done from start to finish because it was super detailed... it's just not reasonable to expect us to go into that level of detail for so many readings per week. I made copious notes on each lecture + for each reading, added notes from friends, from discussion section, ect... it really was a lot of work... Essays: The first essay is analysing a boundary in one of the readings for the class, the second one requires more outside research and extra sources. You first turn in a draft and then a final version. I spent a lot of time on these... maybe 20h each easily between drafts and final versions. I suggest treating your draft as the final version, because they do grade it expecting a pretty decent essay already. If you a 3-4h effort the night before I really doubt you'll get a good grade on your draft. I was lucky that my TA was amazing and helped me a lot during OH... but once again, this took a lot of time and effort on my end. Once again, you have been warned. The time commitment for this class is insane! You're looking at 3h30 of class + 1h for weekly homework + 4-5h for readings (assuming you only read the articles or sources that are less than 40 pages and then read summaries on the novels or bigger movies, otherwise it's even more...). That's 10 hours a week for basic stuff. Then add the time for essays (easily 40h a quarter) plus studying for the finals and organising all your class notes and reading notes (easily another 30h)... divide it all amongst 10 weeks and you're looking at 15-20h of work per week to get an A (some weeks more, some less depending on when deadlines are coming up...).  Even if you don't want an A and you just want pass the class, I really doubt you can get away with less than 10h a week of work... If you love anthro and this is your jam, by all means go for it, it is doable.But if you just want to take an interesting GE and get your writing II credit, learn a bit about something different, and have a manageable work load, this class is NOT it"
Luke Yarbrough,NA,Islam and Other Religions,ISLM ST M115,A," TLDR: It's a scoring class with interesting material, however you need to put in  effort. So it is not difficult, but it is time consuming. I would recommend you to take this class and Prof Yarbrough is a great lecturer. Took this class partly online as it was in Winter 2022. The professor is great to listen to and the lectures and subject matter are generally interesting. This is an upper div but I took this class as a freshman and got an A. Prof Yarbrough is a good teacher and interesting to listen to with a sense of humor. The class is about Islam and how it has interacted with other religions (or societies) in many different ways. Themes taught in the class include the treatment of non-Muslims in Islamic empires, Islam and violence, Muslims in Europe now etc. He makes lectures very interesting and I liked the lectures a lot. Most classes were structured like this: The professor will explain some basic concepts, dive deeply and analyze some examples like a case study, give a conclusion and then present like an original insight/takeaway from this. It was interesting and engaging. Lectures were fun, the readings were not. There are a lot of readings and you will NEED to do the readings. Expect around 60-100 pages of reading a week. Most of the readings will be very dense, academic texts or really old historical texts and they will be dry and challenging. The readings are rigorous and will need effort. 60% of the total grade is more or less guaranteed if you do the very very bare minimum and you can easily score 80% with minimal effort, getting an A requires some effort but again it's not a difficult class.  One good thing is that all the readings (which reading is due for when) and the syllabus (which mentions the focus question for each week, details about your final paper etc) are given to you at the start of the class itself so you can plan accordingly and get ahead if you have some free time early on. Grading:10% Discussion section attendance10% Discussion section participation10% Weekly Focus Question Submission10% Weekly Micro-Quiz20% Midterm 20% Final Exam20% Final Paper More info: 1. Each week you submit a one page focus question response with each response worth 1% of your total grade. So there will be a focus question which will basically require you to answer it and use evidence from the readings to support your answer. However, this did not take much time because you do not really need to present a world class essay or anything. Just have complete sentences and cite the appropriate evidence from the readings (which after reading the focus question you can search the readings for key words and quickly find) and you will be fine. Honestly I wrote most of these before I even went through the readings and each week's response took under 20 mins to do so I was fine. 2. Micro-quiz: at the start of every Thursday's lecture, we will have a 10 minute 5 question micro-quiz with fill in the blanks, MCQ or T/F questions. Each micro-quiz is worth 1% of your grade. The quiz will be about the big picture ideas of the readings or basically be a multiple choice question about what is the thesis of the author of a certain reading. It is a pass/fail micro-quiz meaning you get full credit if you get 3/5 correct or more and you get 0 if you get 2/5 or below. Even if you barely skim the readings, this should be easy. I went through many of these without doing the readings and still passed the quiz because I used my common sense. 3. The mid-term and the final have half of the questions allocated to content from lectures and half to readings alone. So half of your questions will be exclusively from the readings. The questions are very straightforward and quite basic so if you did the readings you will be fine and won't have to sweat, but that said you need to do the readings. 60% of each exam is based on MCQ/ TF/ Fill Blanks questions and the remaining 40% was based on 2 essay questions (500 words each). That said, the 2 essays were chosen from an essay bank of 5 questions that was released like a week before so you can prepare for this easily. Our exams were open book so that was great too, though I do not know if they will be open book or online henceforth after Winter 2022. 4. The final paper basically requires you to do what the professor does in each lecture: analyze an interaction across a boundary and draw an original insight from that, and using the readings (separate readings assigned for the final paper) explain what happened, how this interaction played out and why it happened the way it did and not any other way. You will be given like 3-4 different choices and you can pick a topic. Again, the details of the final paper are released more than a month in advance so it is easy and nothing to stress about. My paper was like 6 pages so not a big deal."
Luke Yarbrough,NA,Islam and Other Religions,RELIGN M115,A," Ok, so I took this GE since I needed another class.  I'm saying this review as someone who has very little original interest in Islam.  I will discuss each portion by itself. Professor: Yarbrough is one of the best lecturers I have ever had in my life.  He is funny, engaging, and extremely well spoken.  Classes are 75mins, and while they do feel long, it's not nearly as bad with Yarbrough as it is with other professors.  I went to his office hours once, and he was nice and friendly.  While being very nice, I doubt that he's lenient, though I've never been put in a position where I had to test this.   Easiness:This is not a free A, but there is a good chance to get an A with a decent amount of effort.  This class is not hard, but does take effort/time. Time Consumption:This class takes lots of time.  There is an above average amount of reading in this class, and the once a week HW assignment takes a decent amount of time.  Readings:Unfortunately, you can't get away with not doing the readings.  Both the midterm and final are half based off the readings, as are the weekly assignment.  I can't imagine getting more than a 80% (at the absolute most, more realistically 50%) in this class without reading.  There is about 40-70 pages of reading, depending on the week.  Interest:I didn't really like the subject, but that's just me.  Still, it ended up being mildly interesting.    Key Assignments: There is a midterm, final, and final essay, all put together worth ~60% of the grade.  If you take decent notes during lecture and while reading, you should get at least a high B/low A on the midterm/final once you review.  You'll have to study ~ 4 hours for each, so not that bad (if your notes don't suck).  Final essay is 5 pages with about 80 pages of reading.  Get started early so that it doesn't conflict with your finals.   Overall: Great professor, lots of work for a GE, not that difficult.  Extremely fair and organized."
Luke Yarbrough,NA,Islam and Other Religions,RELIGN M115,A-,"I was really excited for this class until it started. We were assigned an insane amount of readings each week, ranging from 80-120pages worth of readings. We were required to engage thoroughly with each reading, as were was a weekly quiz/focus question, as well as a cumulative midterm for weeks 1-5 and final (6-10). The readings were very complex and boring, which is unfortunate because with religion classes there are so many beautiful, informational readings that could have been assigned, but we were instead required to read historical theory, jargon filled readings that really turned me and so many others away from the subject. I have taken multiple religion classes before and this one by far has been the worst because of its heavy workload and uninteresting material.  This class definitely took the cake for being my most time consuming course thus far."
Luke Yarbrough,NA,Islam and Other Religions,RELIGN M115,A+,"Dr. Yarbrough is awesome! Even though this class was online, I looked forward to all his lectures. However, if you'd like to take this as an easy GE with little prior interest about Islam, I'd advise against it. There is a lot of readings/work every week with a reading quiz and reading reflection and it was a lot to keep up with. However, if you are interested in Islam and have room for a more heavy GE I'd highly recommend! I learned so much and I am so happy I took this class. The tests require studying but are very fair. they truly demonstrate your knowledge and questions are fairly straightforward."
Luke Yarbrough,NA,Islam and Other Religions,RELIGN M115,A,"Unfortunately Dr. Yarbrough will leave UCLA after spring 2020 to do research in Israel. He is a humorous and very clear professor. He is also caring and quick to respond. One thing though is the class consists of small points, especially participation is 25%. Tests are a bit tricky, mainly because there are so many readings. In short, he is great, but you will have to read a lot every week to do well."
Luke Yarbrough,NA,Islam and Other Religions,RELIGN M115,A,"By far, my most favorite class ever! I didn't know much about Islam before taking this class, as I had only chosen to take it for my GE, but this class opened up my eyes to a whole different level. I learned so much not only about Islam and Muslims, but about the interactions between Islam and Christianity, and Muslims and other races/ethnicities. I was able to see connections regarding similarities and places of conflict when differences were shown. It helped me see a lot of issues in a whole different light, and realize how sometimes the media manipulates issues regarding Islam and its followers. I even got the chance to visit a mosque, which was so interesting. We even had a meal there. Overall,  Yarbrough is a great lecturer and helps us understand the concepts, even if some of the religious concepts may be hard to understand. Every week, I looked forward to coming to class and learning more. Yarbrough also loves to make funny jokes, which helps make lecture go faster. The grade breakdown for this class is Attendance (5%), Class Participation (20%), Micro Quizzes (10%), Focus Question Weekly Answers (10%), Midterm Examination (20%), Micro-Final (15%), and Final Essay (20%).  I would highly recommend taking this class!"
Jessica Lynch-Alfaro,NA,Integrative Approaches to Human Biology and Society,SOC GEN 5,A+,"Do not be scared of the readings!! You don't really need to do them, maybe skim them and know the general idea. Everything else will be gone over in lecture and the mandatory discussion. The exams are very direct, and they provide midterm and final study guides (terms/key concepts to know). The material is actually really interesting, however, they don't post slides so make sure you have a friend to get the lecture slides from if you miss.  There is one 7 page essay, but it is easy because you are making a mock trial testimony thing so you can talk like a regular person. Highly recommend this class as an easy and interesting GE!!"
Jessica Lynch-Alfaro,NA,Integrative Approaches to Human Biology and Society,SOC GEN 5,A-,"Beware of the amount of reading required for this class. The exams are alright as long as you did the study guide and understood all the terms. Overall, this was a pretty generic GE. I am also selling the printed book of Island of Dr. Moreau for 5 dollars. Feel free to message me at 661-292-9419."
Jessica Lynch-Alfaro,NA,Integrative Approaches to Human Biology and Society,SOC GEN 5,A+," This was my favorite class I have taken so far at UCLA.  Professor Lynch-Alfaro is an AMAZING professor who genuinely cares about both the subject and her students.  There are a few reading assignments each week, but I found them really interesting.  Along with that, there are short weekly assignments for the discussion section.  There are also a few 5 question reading quizzes throughout the course and if you do the reading and pay attention in lecture, you can definitely get a 100% on all of them, which is nice because they count for 20% of the final grade.  The rest is just one 7 page paper, a midterm and  final.  The midterm and final are both multiple choice/short answer/long answer.   Grading:20% reading quizzes20% discussion (based on weekly assignments and participation)20% essay20% midterm20% final This is such a manageable course and the topics are extremely interesting and important.  Would definitely recommend to all!"
Jessica Lynch-Alfaro,NA,Integrative Approaches to Human Biology and Society,SOC GEN 5,A-,"One 7 page paper One midterm and one finalGreatest teacher every! recommend to all students. Easy material to understand. tests could be challenging but not too hard.Multiple choice, short answer and long answer tests. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
Jessica Lynch-Alfaro,NA,Genetic Concepts for Human Sciences,SOC GEN 101,N/A,"Soc Gen 5 I had professor Alfaro for the second half of the course  (Professor Landecker taught the first half). Professor Alfaro was great ! Everything you need to do well on the quizzes and final were her power points, which I suggest to definitely print out & memorize. She tries to keep the class engage and is really passionate about the subject & she is SO helpful during office hours! Because of office hours, I did really well on the the final :DThis isn't a hard class and I totally recommend it ! "
Jessica Lynch-Alfaro,NA,,SOC GEN 102W,N/A," Actual class taken: Society and Genetics 5 Dr. Lynch Alfaro taught the second half of the course, the first half was taught by Dr. Landecker. Lynch Alfaro was by far the better professor. She did a good job of holding students attention, but the lectures were still somewhat dull.  She was very kind when I attended office hours and was happy to help students who asked. The grading consisted of the following:Participation: 20%Midterm 20%Paper 20%Quizzes 20%Final 20% Participation was simply attending discussion, doing the standing assignment each week (read 2 of the assigned articles and write key terms, a 1 sentence summary, and 1 question you have for each article), and actually participate a little bit.  It's easy points. The midterm consisted of multiple choice, short answer, and essay questions.  It was graded harshly.  You would get marked down for not using specific words on questions or for not including enough information on what many thought was the least important part of the question.  The average on the midterm was a C. The paper is 7 pages on antibiotic resistance or the microbiome. It consists of 2 different 3 page mock testimonies to congress on the issue and a 1 page introduction.  Pretty easy stuff. There were 5 quizzes (all in the second half of the course).  5 multiple choice questions.  They were supposed to cover the readings and lectures from the previous two classes, but honestly just review the lecture notes and you'll ace all of them.  The lowest score gets dropped, so 4 quizzes at 5% of your grade each. The final was not cumulative (midterm took place really early) and was actually easier than the midterm.  Again, multiple choice, short answer, and essay questions. There are a lot of assigned readings.  It is worth it to read all of them early on (make sure to highlight and take notes) to help with the paper.  After the paper, there really isn't a reason to read more than necessary to complete the standing assignment each week. The class isn't too difficult.  There are definitely easier GEs out there, though.   Also, I highly recommend you print out the lecture slides and use them to take notes.  It will make it much easier to pay attention to what is said in lecture."
Jessica Lynch-Alfaro,NA,Problems of Identity at Biology/Society Interface,SOC GEN 105B,N/A,"Idk if this is an unpopular opinion but I thought this class was bad. It's a shame since I was really looking forward to it since the topic of addiction is extremely interesting and important and it was a core major course. The lectures were the worst as the professor just reads word for word from jam-packed blocks of texts that basically just reiterate what was already on the reading and most people stopped going after the first week. I often had no idea how we were progressing through themes/topics by week, and it seemed intellectually disorganized. Readings were often really dense and over-focused on the neurobiology of addiction at the expense of other topics/angles. I like HBS major classes that embrace the interactive learning model and that approach topics from an interdisciplinary lens and the overall unengaging course style and readings I felt didn't align with the major. The workload itself for the class was fairly easy/light though as all that is required is weekly ""standing assignments"" which are like reading reflections, going to discussion sections and participating, doing a film/book review on a piece with themes of addiction, a final essay, an open book midterm, and an open book final. Didn't feel like I needed to put too much time into the project or essay, but that could just be me, and same for the exams as they were open note and we had a pretty good amount of time. I feel like this review will be unpopular because the professor herself is nice and cares about her students and the workload/grading wasn't bad at all, but I felt like I didn't learn as much as I wanted. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't have to take it for a major/minor, but if you do, there are definitely worse classes at UCLA."
Jessica Lynch-Alfaro,NA,Problems of Identity at Biology/Society Interface,SOC GEN 105B,A," This class was interesting, but a bit difficult for me coming in as a new HBS major who wasn't used to writing essays. Professor Lynch Alfaro is easily one of my favorite professors in the ISG and at UCLA. She is a clear lecturer with organized lectures, encourages thoughtful discussion, asks for student feedback, and genuinely cares about her students. For this class, my TA was Celeste and she was also a wonderful TA: super kind and caring, always smiling, and very helpful when it came to the essays. This class is graded on the basis of 3 essays (15% each), a final (30%), reading quizzes on CCLe (8 out of the 10 weeks) , section attendance/participation (this is just showing up, mostly), and clicker questions. The material of this class is interesting, but since it bridges more into the humanities than I was used to as a science major, I often times had to reread through the material to understand it. There are readings assigned each week, and honestly, I stopped reading them 4 weeks in and did just fine, as the most important points (needed for the essay, final) are highlighted on the lecture slides. For the essays, the TAs basically tell you what readings to use so you can use this to hone in on the specific ones to draw evidence from.  The first essay is definitely the hardest but the prompts get progressively easier. For the essays, I would say to start early and attend section to know what the TAs are looking for.  The final is relatively easy, it was about 100 or so T/F and multiple choice questions that really were just dependent on recall."
Jessica Lynch-Alfaro,NA,Problems of Identity at Biology/Society Interface,SOC GEN 105B,B,"Interesting material, very engaging. Come to class on time to make sure you receive the clicker points for participation. My TA was great but a tough grader. Got a solid B in the course although I think I could have done better."
Jessica Lynch-Alfaro,NA,Hormones and Behavior in Humans and Other Animals,ANTHRO M128R,A+,"I loved her. She was an absolute gem. I genuinely enjoyed this class so much. She had a HARD focus on fulfilling the diversity requirement, which I really enjoyed in a science course. You can tell that she cares very deeply about the issues she discusses, is very mindful and caring towards students, super patient, is willing to work with students and is very understanding. I have never had a professor this sweet before, and I never even went to her office hours. Though I probably should have. I would take 10 more courses with her if I could. I feel like a learned a whole lot while also taking it easy and not being stressed out at all throughout the quarter. She gave many extra credit opportunities, including watching a movie on conversion therapy, writing a short page on gender identity, etc. She is so great. She even extended one of the due dates for an assignment in case students didn't have enough time, and she even agreed to drop the lowest quiz score for the entire class because some students were experiencing technical problems on the website while taking them. Amazing!Overall, the class is really interesting. Makes you think about gender and sexuality in a different way. There are 5 online quizzes (she dropped the lowest one), two midterms, and one research paper that is very fluid and very clear on what she wants you to do. Very straight forward overall, she makes sure everyone is on the same page like all the time. We also were lucky to have an amazing TA (Andrew) who was super helpful and sweet and made the class even better. This was probably one of the best classes I've taken at UCLA thus far."
Jessica Lynch-Alfaro,NA,Hormones and Behavior in Humans and Other Animals,SOC GEN M140,A," I took this class Fall of 2017 with Lynch Alfaro and Schlinger and received an A. I would highly recommend taking this class as an elective. It builds upon some knowledge of the classes and actions of hormones, as well as the endocrine system, so a background is helpful (but not necessary). Overall, this class was pretty interesting, clearly taught, and not too much work.  CLASS FORMATThe first half of the class was taught by Professor Schlinger, who is very knowledgable about songbirds. For the first few lectures he didn't use slides but taking notes wasn't too difficult. The second half was taught by Lynch Alfaro, whose slides were clear and pretty easy to follow. WORKThere is assigned reading, and a reading quiz on CCLE (8 or so qs) on one of the readings every week. You need to do quizzes 8 out of 10 weeks. They are fairly easy. The readings are definitely not necessary; you only need to know what is mentioned in lecture.  TEXTBOOKThere is a textbook for this class, but it definitely is not necessary.  GRADINGThe grade is based off of a midterm, final, clicker participation (there are free days), section attendance, and final paper (7 pages). The tests are very straightforward and fair (MC, matching, short answer, and essays). Make sure you watch the videos because they came up on the exams. The final paper is pretty straightforward as well."
Jessica Lynch-Alfaro,NA,Hormones and Behavior in Humans and Other Animals,SOC GEN M140,A," CLASS:The class, Hormones and Behavior in Humans and Other Animals, is highly interesting if a bit confusing in the beginning. It covers hormones in humans, fish, birds, rats, and other species like many non-human primates. It didn't feel like I went to class since there wasn't a discussion section and it was at 9:30 so I was asleep for it most of the time. The tests are doable if you study the material. UNDERSTAND TINBERGEN'S FOUR QUESTIONS (anthro term if you don't know it) LYNCH ALFARO:JLA is a highly helpful professor who teaches the majority of the course aside from Schlinger and some guest speakers.  She makes herself available for Skype office hours and is always helpful and availabl e. SCHLINGER:Schlinger is  grumpy old man who doesn't really care about students. He's obsessed with birds, which is what he teaches about (songbirds, manakins, and general physiology of male/female reproductive systems and hormones associated with it). His lectures aren't podcasted and he flaked on me for an office hour once. He only teaches like 5-6 lectures so I still recommend the course, and his material is not ultra heavily tested on the exams."
Jessica Lynch-Alfaro,NA,Hormones and Behavior in Humans and Other Animals,PHYSCI M140,A,"I just couldn't help to leave a review. I liked the class, it was pretty easy and fun. Dr. Lynch Alfaro was a very very nice professor. The only thing that bothers me is that her lecture was not well organized. It was compiled with abundant facts here and there. At least to me, she did not present a full picture of her topic. Everything else was good."
Niko Besnier,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"I don't know why people don't like Professor Besnier. I actually went to each and every one of the lectures (and believe lectures aren't my thing ...) because I thoroughly enjoyed them. And even though he did summarize the readings, he also put in some new, thought-provoking points. And because he did summarize the readings, you didn't actually have to do the readings if you didn't want to. I did because it was worth my time. I thought this class was an eye-opener for the world and culture outside of America. I don't see how it's difficult to do well in the class. The only thing I didn't particularly thoroughly enjoy was the Research paper, but other than that, pure pleasure."
Niko Besnier,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"i really enjoyed the class; besnier was a bit long-winded, but overall an interesting character to see in front of a lecture hall.  i stopped going to the lectures after the first midterm; it was really easy to do well on the tests, as long as you did the reading and go to the discussions. I felt I gained a lot more from the discussions than i did from the actual lectures.  the questions on the exams were WAY easy, and as long as you got down the general principals and a few examples (which besnier and the TAs would beat into your head; i must have heard about tuvaluans a million times) you're bound to get a good grade.  overall, i'd recommend anyone who doesn't mind reading to take the class."
Niko Besnier,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"this class is the biggest waste of time. there is no point in going to class, because all the professor does is summarize what is in the readings, which are so boring and pointless. the ta's do nothing but grade your exams hard. the class is out of 100 points with no curve which isn't fun. and of course, the midterm and final are both essays. i am pre-comm so i needed to take this class, but don't unless you absolutely have to. it is horrible and i would not recommend it."
Niko Besnier,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"While I hear that the other teacher last quarter for this class was a lot worse, I have a hard time trying to understand that.  The exams for this class are based entirely on the book and the reader, which is nice, because then I don't have to try to stay awake during the lectures.  In fact, after three times I simply stopped going.  Besnier goes in circles and doesn't really say anything that you can't divulge from reading the stuff you have to read anyway.  Oh well."
Niko Besnier,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"Either Prof. Besnier has made a complete about-face in the past year, or past reviewers have some sort of personal grudge against him.  True, he can seem somewhat arrogant.  But all in all, he's an excellent and interesting lecturer who is definitely not Euro-centric.  In lecture, he uses examples of peoples from all over the world, according each of them equal respect.  His class completely turned me on to linguistic anthropology, and I might even change my major.  Either the Polynesian languages and cultures class was just a horrible class and this is a good one, or he has changed, or people need to get over their problems with having a white man teach the class, because his Anthro 33 class was absolutely awesome."
Niko Besnier,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"people who say that Prof. Besnier is a horrible teacher are just bitter jocks and frat boys who got their exams back, and didn't like what they saw. It's not the Prof.'s fault that you slept through class and didn't do the readings. and it's not the TA's fault that you can't write a decent paper to save your life. get over it. Personally, I found Besnier's lectures very interesting and engaging, which is extremely rare in my experience at UCLA. He mixed personal experience and knowledge with textual and researched data that created a well rounded lecture. I'm sure you could pass the class without attending lecture, but lecture was INTERESTING, although not completely mandatory for the average student. I would much rather go to an interesting lecture, than go to one where I have to furiously write EVERYTHING the professor says in order to even pass the course. everyone should stop whining, professor besnier is great."
Niko Besnier,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"I loved him... he has so much to offer, and is very open to questions, although he doesn't really bend in his opinions (which in itself says something...). People liked to say he was ""arrogant,"" but I thought he was very intelligent, and people percieved his ""non-spoon-feeding-of-information"" as cocky. Whatever... I'd recommend him FOR SURE."
Niko Besnier,NA,Study of Social Systems,ANTHRO 140,N/A,"Besnier is a good teacher. I dreaded taking this class because I wasn't interested, and only took it because I had to. This was one of the few classes I came out of with much more interest than I went in with. He is organized and very clear. He asks for questions and is willing to discuss things. He is a fair grader. His multiple choice questions are worded funny sometimes and he has a tendency to have two correct answers, one being general and the other more specific to his question, but overall they aren't too bad. The essay questions are fair.Besnier may be a bit arrogant,but most professors are downright narcissistic. My only real complaint is the incessant dumbing down power-point. It is impossible to keep up decent notes, listen to lecture and read the constant power-point screens. Besnier is a good teacher. He doesn't need it."
Sharman Babior,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,Awesome professor! Her class is very straight forward. If you do the reading and pay attention in class you will get an A.  The essays are really chill and are fun to write. Take her!!!
Sharman Babior,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"Prof. Babior's class got me interested in Anthropology.  For anyone even considering the major/minor or just wanting to fulfill a GE, you couldn't ask for a more clear, or well prepared instructor.  At times, she seems almost too thorough, but that's because she's so concerned that you understand the concepts.  Her papers, projects, and TA's were great.  Unlike some professors, Babior actually takes the time in OH to speak to you, and remember you.  In addition. she prepares her TA's too, so you really can use them as a resource."
Sharman Babior,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A," Babior is a pretty good professor.  Lectures can go by a bit slowly at times, but she knows her material very well.  Most of the reading wasn't too bad but is definitely needed to pass the exams.  The subject matter discussed in class is often interesting. Speaking of exams...the tests for this class are really strange.  I took the midterm and final and walked out feeling confident about acing everything--and I ended up with a B in the class.  My TA was Ayana, who was very smart and friendly, but I think she was a pretty hard grader."
Sharman Babior,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"Engaging lectures, very interesting reading-- a great course with a great professor.  Dr. Babior is intelligent without being pretentious, explicative without being dry.Go for it!"
Sharman Babior,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"This was a good class for the most part. I wasn't too happy with my grade, but that was partially my fault.  Although, I will say that she has a crazy curve that actually hurts you more than it helps you.  I probably got about an 87 percent in the class and ended up with a B-.  I wasn't super happy, especially because I always came out of tests thinking I aced them.  However, on an interest scale, I thoroughly enjoyed the readings Professor Babior chose.  They are long, but keep your attention well.  Lectures are extremely boring, I fell asleep during many of them.  In fact, almost all of the material she covers in the lectures is in the reading, the Lavenda and Shultz book in particular.  Still, this is a hard class to flunk, and if you are simply in need of units, by all means take the class."
Sharman Babior,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"All in all, a great GE course.  Professor Babior is knowledgable, keeps lectures reasonably interesting, and gives fair tests.  Both of the assignments (mini-papers with little extras)were fairly easy (started the night before on both and received high marks on both).  The tests were very reasonable, especially if you had read the majority of the assigned reading and payed attention in class.  I recommend this class and professor to anyone who needs a semi-interesting GE course that won't kill your GPA."
Sharman Babior,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,Prof. Babior is a great person and teacher. Her lectures are very organized and she goes at a reasonable pace. The readings for the class aren't that bad. She doesn't ask really detailed questions on the exam. You can get by with reading them once or sorta skimming. Most of the stuff from the reading that she wants you to know she goes over in lecture or it's gone over in discussion sections. I'd recommend going to all lectures and discussions because they helped me a lot for the exams when I sorta didn't get to finish all of the ethnnographies ;) Her exams are fair and she gives you study guides that cut your study time. I'd definitely recommend this professor and this class as a G.E.
Sharman Babior,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,This is a great GE to take...GREAT professor.
Sharman Babior,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"she is very knowledgeable and the subject is interesting, but this class involved a lot of reading and lectures became boring quickly.prof babior focuses on lectures and on the reading in her tests, so you HAVE to do ALL the reading to get a good grade.  ..not all its cracked up to be, but still a pretty decent course."
Sharman Babior,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"Professor Babior's teaching style encorporates students' opinions and ideas.  In that way, it is a very entertaining lecture.  Her reading selections are fun, and it is a fairly easy class over all. I would highly recommend it to others. She is a genuinely nice person who is very concerned in student learning."
Sharman Babior,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,Professor Babior is a really good professor and a geniunely a nice person. Her lectures are really organized and interesting.  I would recommend this class to anybody.
Sharman Babior,NA,Violence Against Women in Cross-Cultural Perspectives,HNRS 122,N/A,Babior is an amazing professor and person.  My three hour seminar went by so fast because she kept it so interesting.  she was really passionate about her class.
Sharman Babior,NA,Study of Social Systems,ANTHRO 140,N/A,"Professor Babior is by far the best anthro professor I've had!!! Not only is she knowledgable and fair, she cares for her students and is very approachable.  Her lectures are interesting, and she explains concepts clearly to prepare you for the exams.  There were 3 short papers based on ethnographies and a multiple choice midterm and final.  Babior is one of those very few teachers at UCLA that you will want to take more classes with. I did :)"
Sharman Babior,NA,Study of Social Systems,ANTHRO 140,N/A,She's a decent lecturer and she doesn't grade too hard. And she's approachable and a really nice person.
Sharman Babior,NA,History of Anthropology,ANTHRO 182,N/A,"Good professor. She has well-organized lectures, very interesting readings, and is very knowledgable about the material that she teaches. She is great at repeating concepts over and over again so if you miss it the first time, you won't miss it the second time. It helps to go to lecture and take good notes because 90 percent of her exams are based on lecture. You should do the readings if you have time, but if not, skim and look for examples that will help you on the essay portion of the exams. She gives two exams during the quarter with the midterm being 45 percent and the final being 55 percent. The tests are pretty easy with the format being multiple choice and 2 essays. She doesn't try to trick you with the multiple choice answers so just be prepared to answer all of the above for most of them. She is really good about talking to students outside of her class and helping you along. She is very nice too."
Sharman Babior,NA,History of Anthropology,ANTHRO 182,N/A,"Professor Babior is an extremely intelligent and caring person. She truly cared about the students and was very helpful with any questions we had. The exams were fair, there was a lot of notes and material( readings) to go over but she gave us a study guide which really help. Take her honors section if you can it's the best"
Sharman Babior,NA,History of Anthropology,ANTHRO 182,N/A,"Dr. Babior is one of the nicest professors I have encountered here at UCLA.  She is very concise and succinct.  She makes her lectures very easy to understand and her tests are more than fair.  She is very available for students outdside of class (in class, too) and is eager to help.  Overall, she is a terrific professor.  I highly recommend her!"
Sharman Babior,NA,History of Anthropology,ANTHRO 182,N/A,"One of the best professors at UCLA. She cares a lot for her students and actually makes an effort to learn peoples' names. How many teachers can you say that about. It really says a lot about her. Her lectuers are very interesting, and well organized. She starts the day with an outline of what she is going to talk about. She has been criticized for being a little dry. This is sometimes true, but relative to other teachers she is not. We did have a good amount of reading, but it was all interesting material. If you are an anthro major this class is essential for future success in the field. Take this with her, and any other class she offers. She is always at office hours and will always make appointments if you want to. She is also EXTREMELY easy to talk with outside of class. It never felt like I was talking with my professor, but it felt like I was talking with a friend."

Kenneth Burrell,NA,Ellingtonia,ETHNOMU M111,A+,"Easy A, take him."
Kenneth Burrell,NA,Ellingtonia,ETHNOMU M111,N/A,This is a notoriously easy class. That being said expect to meet some of the most questionable people of ucla. Professor Burrell is a really cool guy and I met most of the ethnomusicology and jazz majors and they are awesome! But a lot of people in this class were super disrespectful to Professor Burrell and makes you question how these people even got into ucla....wow....ANYWAY....I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CLASS.
Kenneth Burrell,NA,Ellingtonia,ETHNOMU M111,N/A,"Easy GE only 3 assignments, if you don't want to read the books just show up to lecture, jot a few notes and you got your essay there. Final exam is take home 7 questions with an 8th optional about how this class has helped you. pretty cool that you get to take a class with a jazz legend Kenny Burrell. JAZZ"
Kenneth Burrell,NA,Ellingtonia,ETHNOMU M111,N/A," Mr. Burrell is a good and fair teacher, but not necessarily one I'd recommend. While he loves his subject, Duke Ellington, the scope of the class is too narrow to spend 10 weeks on. After a while it gets repetitive.  He is not a fast speaker, but his lecture style is good enough and he incorporates both music and video into his teaching. Being a musician, he is not really up to the level of lecturing UCLA students are accustomed to. He is however, very nice and understanding and does everything he can to make the class enjoyable and informative. While I enjoyed the class at times, most of the time I found myself losing concentration as he went over the same topics again and again. As far as grading, this class is very easy. I took very few notes and did no readings until I wrote the two required papers and I got an A in the class. Pros: Initially interesting subject, taught by a Jazz legend, Very easy A, no notes required, no readings required, Very nice teacher Cons: Repetitive, Slow Speaker, Too narrow of a subject"
Kenneth Burrell,NA,Ellingtonia,ETHNOMU M111,N/A,"I took this class for Ellingtonia...Easy A!!! And the material is really interesting, I enjoyed the class. I have both the Duke Ellington books and can sell them for $30 for both!! contact me at a_keilo@yahoo.com"
Kenneth Burrell,NA,Ellingtonia,ETHNOMU M111,N/A," Took this class Winter 2010. 3 Assignments. No exams. All take home papers. Midterm Paper 4-6 pagesTerm Paper 6-8 PagesFinal Paper 6-8 Pages (Answer the 7 questions he gives you) That's it. The class meets once a week for 10 weeks. Don't have to show up during the final's week. He's really flexible about when to turn in the assignments too.  As far as the class goes, very interesting material the first few weeks. The class is set up that the first 1.5 hours is lecture/discussion, break 10 minutes, then a video for 1.5 hours. As far as I understand, you will get an A for just doing the 3 assignments. Attendance is mandatory though as he has a sign-in sheet. Prof Burrell is an amazing person. But I can agree with the comments regarding the class setup. It's seems a little mismatched with people from a music background and those without. We don't go into music theory, but talk mostly about the man himself.... Which is nice for the first few weeks, but then gets a bit repetitive. Overall, easy class. I enjoyed it.  "

C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,Selling The Power of The Between by Stoller.Contact me if you are interested at (714) 271-4082. Thanks!
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,A," I took this course to satisfy one of my GE requirements. It was very engaging and overall a good choice if you're looking for a GE that is both an ""easy A"" and engaging. Professor Throop is very passionate about anthropology, which makes his lectures on occasionally dry topics much more bearable. He is extremely vocal about his distaste for laptops in the classroom, so be prepared to take notes by hand if you normally type them. There is one midterm, two short papers, and the final. Both the midterm and final are very straightforward. He provides a list of topics for you to review beforehand. I made a few flashcards of the material and was able to score a 90% on the midterm and a 94% on the final. The exams contain a few extra credit questions from his own book, which is optional to purchase for the class. I read a bit of the book and felt that I still didn't really know the extra credit questions, so I just gave an educated guess. I'm sure if you take the time to read the book, you could answer the questions, but it's really not necessary considering that the test is very easy and you likely won't need extra credit. My only complaint with this class is the sections. They were almost always a huge waste of time and attendance was mandatory. The discussions that we had felt very forced, and I didn't really gain much from them. There is A LOT of reading required for the section, and you have to submit a response to each reading assignment every week. I usually didn't mind the readings, but it does take up a lot of time if you are already busy with other classes. This class is very interesting, and Professor Throop made me appreciate anthropology a lot more than I used to. While this class does have a lot of assigned reading, it is a great GE to take if you're looking for a GPA booster and an engaging lecture."
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,B,"Good class, very thorough professor. Class material was interesting, you need to pay close attention to lecture as he does not post slides."
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,B+,"Throop was a good professor and I enjoyed taking the class because of the material. Every week there were summaries due on assigned readings. There were two essays. I would've gotten an A in the class but the essays are graded by different TAs, and I got a 90% on the first and a 60% on the second. The quality of writing and effort on both papers were the same so I just kinda got screwed. Good class overall though."
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,A-,"Professor Throop is an engaging lecturer, who presents interesting ideas. I would strong recommend, being prepared to show up to every class, as he does not give out notes, and bringing a pen and paper, as he does not allow computers. It is a tough class for a GE, with a lot of reading, but worth taking ultimately."
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,A-,"I thoroughly enjoyed this class. I would advise to taking anthro 9 only if throop is teaching it because i've heard poor things about other professors teaching the same course. Throop is a super chill guy that really knows what he's talking about. Although there is a lot of reading to do a lot of it is very interesting and engaging in that it changes your perspective and assumptions. The midterm and final are also easy, both multiple choice and as long as you go to lecture and review the study guide you'll be fine. Overall a decently easy and interesting class, definitely my favorite class so far at ucla."
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,A,"This was quite the easy class. There was a fair amount of reading, but doing it guaranteed you an A on the midterm and the final. Make sure you communicate with your TA as to what they want in a paper so you are on the same page. This will help you get the A. Overall, Throop was knowledgeable but a bit annoying, I got tired of him by the end of the quarter. Make sure you go to all of the lectures and you will be fine."
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,A,"Throop is a super good professor with engaging lectures. However, there's a lot of reading for the class and you definitely need to put time into understanding the texts since they can be rather complicated. The weekly assignments are easy to blow off since they are just summaries of the readings and questions, but you need to understand the articles for the discussion and exams. There are two essays which are simple enough - just make sure you get your article approved and use proper grammar since some of the TAs can be picky. The midterm and final are both multiple choice and I got Bs on both by just completing the study guide the day before."
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,A+,"For this class, there are 2 essays, 1 midterm, and 1 final. However, there are weekly readings that can be a bit lengthy and require summaries (~3-5 sentences) and your own discussion questions. These aren't too bad and are graded pretty easily by your TA; just remember to cite and quote from the readings. The two essays involve comparing and contrasting two articles: one provided to you and the other you have to find on your own. Both essays are worth 25 points and are 5 pages max. The midterm and final are both multiple choice and include 3 extra credit questions. Use the study guide provided to review your notes and readings and they should both be relatively easy (especially if you can make educated guesses). The final though is longer and slightly harder than the midterm, but I still did well. Overall, this is a fairly easy GE. Just do the readings and summaries, go to lecture and take notes and you should be fine. Some topics in the lecture and readings were interesting and Professor Throop can be funny sometimes too. Also, participations counts so don't skip your discussion section."
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,A,"The class looks like this:2 essays, one midterm, and one final.The midterm and final are both multiple choice.The midterm and final are both relatively easy (the final being harder than the midterm for sure... takes some educated guessing). However, you'll be fine as long as you memorize terms, know your anthropologists, and remember your readings.This class was very easy to cram for, as long as you had your notes!! notes are ESSENTIAL in this class! go to lectures and try hard not to sleep (Throop is a great guy--he's funny, kind, and soon chill.. but he's a bit boring. It's hard to listen to anyone talk for an hour and fifteen minutes) through the lecture because the notes are pretty much what is in the tests.DON'T procrastinate for the essays. They take some time, even though both are only five pages. They grade pretty leniently, so  you should be good.The class is an easy A if you do the work. Participation matters-so go to your discussions! and you get weekly readings (which is the bulk of the work in the class) which can be quite long. However, I always got 100 percent on my summaries of them (after two or three assignments, my TA looked like he just stopped grading and just gave A+ for effort lol). The summaries were 3 sentences per chapter/reading.Easy GE, just be prepared to do all the work! Interesting material as well, and the professor is one of the chillest people you'll ever meet."
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"Initially I thought the content was philosophical and hard to understand and that there was quite a lot of reading, but the readings turned out to the very interesting. Prof. Throop might not be the most engaging lecturer in the world but he is very passionate about his research and eventually I found the content to be eye-opening. The exams are much easier than I had expected. If you pay attention in class and do the reading, you'll get an A."
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,F," Great class, one of my favorites I took my first year at Ucla. The professor, as other students mentioned is very down to earth, and the material is interested.  If anyone is interested in buying all of his books for a really good price, email me at cr.crystalramirez098@gmail.com. All the books are practically new, with no writing."
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,A,"Of all the classes I took my first year, this was my favorite.  While harder than most GEs, I found the material very interesting and practical. I found myself thinking about the material outside of class and applying it to my life. Professor Throop is thorough and clear. His slides are simple and informative. He was very invested in this class despite it being a GE. You're going need to put in the work for an A, but in my experience it was entirely worth it."
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,A,"Professor Throop is the nicest and most pleasant professor I have had here at UCLA. Taking cultural anthropology with him was a pleasure--he made the material engaging with just the right combination of general information and his own personal research which of course he was very passionate about. You definitely do need to go to class and discussion to get a good grade. The papers are easy. Midterm and final are all multiple choice. Midterm is easier than final, but both are doable with study guides he provides. Dr. Throop really is down to earth as he plays rock music before class starts, wears the same worn out faded green Converse for the past 10 months now, and is very approachable/caring. Also, you will truly learn how to look at the world from a different perspective. Maybe this class should be the true diversity requirement."
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,A-,"Throop himself was very good at explaining the topics and his lectures were very clear and easy to take notes on. He does not podcast any lectures or post any slides online, which sucks but if you go to class and takes notes the tests are easy. He assigns a hefty amount of reading, 2 books for the quarter and 1-2 long articles a week. Many test questions are based directly on the readings especially on the final so it's hard to avoid doing them.  He provides study guides with all topics that will be on exams. There are 2 papers, which are straightforward if you go to office hours and make sure you're doing everything they want you to. I found the class itself fascinating, which made the work tolerable. Take notes, read, don't screw up the papers and its a pretty easy A."
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A," OVERALL: Dr. Throop’s class on society and culture (ANTHRO 9) was engaging and interesting. To get an A, you have to attend every lecture, have good study habits, and write well. There are a good amount of readings but it is not too demanding.  STRUCTURE: Dr. Throop is very professional but down to earth. When you walk into class early, he’ll have some rock music playing in the background. His slides are organized and aesthetically pleasing, but he doesn’t share them with the class. His class is not podcasted either, so you have to take good notes. I didn’t find it too difficult, especially because Dr. Throop is very mindful of how fast he is speaking and how clear he is making himself. 	The class goes over some anthropological theory, how we orient ourselves to the world, how societies are organized, and what is meant by culture. There’s more, too. There is some focus on the journal articles we read and the novels. I took the class two quarters ago and I still find myself thinking about the information we studied. 	Some of the reviewers here say he talks about his research too much, but that is exaggerated from my experience. Also, I did’t find him disrespectful to anyone. Quite the opposite, Dr. Throop is really courteous and respects us as students. (He even refers to classmates as colleagues.) Dr. Throop is brilliant, and he places value on intellectualism.  GRADES: Midterm, essay, discussion, and final. - The exams are all multiple choice. The average for our midterm was an A. The questions are straightforward if you have done the work.- Don't let the above catch you off guard for the final. The average for that was actually a D, which I find really surprising.  - There are two essays that are worth a nice chunk of your grade. Compare and contrast two anthropological articles. Six pages. - Discussion sections were fine. We mostly reviewed the assigned journal articles and the two novels in the class. You turn a weekly assignment on the readings. My TA, Miss Courtney Cecale, was great.  ADVICE: - There are no materials in the test bank, but you won’t need it.  - Finish the essay well in advance and get feedback from your instructor. - Know how to write before you take this class, or your essay scores will suffer. - Be prepared to do a fair amount of reading. It isn’t too bad, honestly.- Consider taking this class your freshman year. Getting the A is not difficult. I took it as a freshman in Fall of 2013 and it definitely helped me transition into college. If you approach it correctly, this class will give you the discipline you need to be a good student. Dr. Throop doesn’t tolerate talking during his lectures. The rooms are always full, so you’ll have the motivation to attend. The class will push you to read, write, and take good notes. And the discussions are a good opportunity to become comfortable participating in section. "
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"Hey. Professor Throop is really awesome and extremely friendly. He is definitely one of my favorite anthropology professors. He combines his research with his lectures and if you read his book he gives extre credit questions on exams based on book. Also, he gives great study guides for both the midterm and final exam. For anyone interested in cultural anthropology and attemoting to raise their gpa, take Anthro 9 with him. I enjoyed his lectures and kept up with readings and it wasn't hard and stiff like some other anthro courses I have taken."
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"Professor Throop was an interesting lecturer, though at times anecdotal and monotone, the content of his lectures were interesting and often spurred discussion outside of the classroom! His class was enjoyable, the workload is do-able though the readings were a tad long. He is a great professor but that doesn't take away the fact that my TA had no idea how to teach nor did she care much to help. Great lecture but hopefully you will have a better discussion."
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"He is very passionate about the material in class. This class is very engaging and interesting. It is relatively easy, but you have to put a good amount of effort."
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A," Professor Throop is extremely passionate about anthropology. He always talked about his research in Yap, which made him fall behind 2-3 lectures. This forced him to do 2 lectures worth of material on the last day. He is a good lecturer and I wish I could have gotten to know him better over the quarter. His lectures do start exactly on time and finish with 0 minutes to spare, which I found kinda funny. The breakdown for this class is:20% Midterm10% Annotated Bibliography5% Key Themes/ Thesis Assignment20% 8 page paper25% Final Exam20% Participation/Attendance in Discussion Midterm: The midterm was 45 questions based on the readings and lecture material. There were a couple vague questions, but this is expected, since this is an anthropology course. Overall, it wasn’t too bad. Annotated Bibliography + Key Themes/Thesis: Both of these assignments are components of the 8 page paper you will have to write at the end of the quarter. The annotated bibliography takes time since you have to find 5 anthropological articles that are similar. The key themes assignment is where you generate a thesis and essentially outline how you are going to connect the 5 articles into a cohesive paper. Even if you lose a couple points, it doesn’t matter, since they are not worth a lot in the end. 8 page Paper: This isn’t as bad as it seems. Give yourself 2 days to write it and you will be fine. Throop gives you an outline of what to include in the paper, so it’s not hard to reach the limit. In fact, you will probably go over and have to cut it down, since the paper has to be 8 pages. Most people did well on it. Final: The final was 75 questions and frankly, it was pretty hard. There were a bunch of vague questions, but in the end, you can make educated guesses and come away with a decent score. Don’t fret too much. He gives you study guides for both the midterm and final, so if you know that well, you should be fine. I think there was a big curve too. Discussion Section: Section is helpful since we go over the readings, which can be dense. But the TAs in this class were not good. They were really vague and didn’t answer your questions directly. Anyways, you had to show up for discussion and send in 2 discussion questions about the readings a couple of days in advance. Easy way to get points so don’t miss out.  Bottomline: Most people thought the readings in this class were really hard. I NEVER READ A SINGLE READING. They key is to find one good sentence in each reading and write a discussion question about it. If you are able to do this, then you will spend less than 5 min every week on this class. Overall, including all the assignments, I probably only spent 20 hours the entire quarter on this class because I avoided a lot of the unnecessary trouble. Why read something that you won’t understand and that Throop is going to go over in lecture anyways? Take this class for a GE if you can scan read as I did. I got an A in the class. The worst part were the sometimes boring lectures, though Throop does a great job trying to bring life to a boring subject (in my opinion). The fact that it was at 9:30am wasn’t good either."
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"This class was very interesting for the first couple of weeks. Then, I began to feel that the class was way too impersonal with 400 students all in one classroom. Although that was an unfavorable characteristic of the class I still enjoyed it. The class is easy, but I highly recommend students go to office hours. Please try not to get Devaka Gunawardena as a T.A. He was so horrible. He never explained any of the assignments and did not like to explain the material in simpler wording. He struck me as very pompous. Do not expect to fly by this class. It is challenging for a G.E."
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"I can't really make up my mind if I liked this class or not. The lectures were pretty interesting, especially for a random GE class. He assigns a bunch of reading, and definitely pulls the questions on the midterm and final from all the reading. We had one 8 page research paper, which was kind of a bitch. The midterm and final were both multiple choice. I ended up getting a B in the class, and I put in a lot of effort doing the readings and going to all of the classes. I would recommend the class though, just don't slack off on the paper and get to know your TA."
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A," I took Anthropology 9 with him. Worst class I've ever taken at UCLA. Everyone told me the class would be easy...until they found out I had Throop. If your ready to deal with ill-informed TA's with being helpful the last thing on their mind, no lecture slides for his 85minute lecture,incredibly long and dense journal readings, and the vaguest multiple choice you have ever taken then take this class.  You might be asking. How can multiple choice be vague? Take this class and You will find out. I worked my ass off and got a B. I'm satisfied but I guess anthro really isn't for me.  It didn't help that my TA was just not helpful. Same with all of my friends TA's. I had a lot of friends in this class, 1 or 2 to each TA pretty much. Same story they all sucked.  Throop seems like a nice guy but don't expect him to throw you a bone. Lecture is incredibly boring, I've never seen so many people sleeping in 1 class. He also fell behind by 2-3 lectures because he spent so much time talking about his work with pacific islanders. This resulted in him rushing the last lectures which didn't help much for the final.  The final was curved pretty heavily. The class average was a 72%. My friend got a D- and still got a B in the class. out of 360 people 10 of them got 90 or better.  Basically if Anthro is your kinda subject you will probably like this class. For the rest of you out there wanting to just take this for a G.E. Don't take this with Throop. You will have way less reading and easier test with another professor. Just talking to my friends who are anthro majors and took this class with other professors made me mad lol. I had to do about 2-3x the reading they did and had a test full of bs. "
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A," Throop is a great professor and truly has a passion for his work and his teachings.  The lectures are for the most part very interesting, but he does not post his power points online, so be sure to take good notes.  I would definitely recommend this class to people who are interested in anthropology or looking for a good G.E. class for the social analysis requirement.  The class consisted of 3 writing projects: 1 annotated bibliography of 5 articles that you find on a subject of your choice, 1 thesis statement about the articles, and an 8 page research paper once again about the same 5 articles. The midterm was 45 multiple choice questions and the final was 75 multiple choice questions.   This class was my first anthropology class, and it was very intriguing and Throop really makes his ideas clear during lecture.  There was a lot of reading, but the articles and books were not too difficult, and were for the most part very interesting. My final grade: A+ "
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"Great professor, interesting lectures and very knowledgeable. I took this class to test if I would enjoy an Anthro minor and he definitely helped to peak my interest in the subject. The assignments are well spread out, the reading can be a bit lengthy but most of them are interesting. Good professor and interesting easy class.  "
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A, Best. Professor. Ever. He is really popular during office hours so I didn't really get to talk to him much but his lectures are interesting and he is very nice and helpful. I spoke to him all of two times and he was very warm to me after the final. I don't know what the other review is talking about!
C Jason Throop,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,A very knowledgeable professor in his field but quite rude to students that he doesn't regard as intelligent or that he doesn't have a liking for. 
C Jason Throop,NA,Introduction to Psychological Anthropology: Historical Development,ANTHRO 136A,N/A," Avoid this guy at all costs. His lectures are sleep-inducing, and for 135A the material is so vague and abstract that you will never be able to give him what he wants on assignments...Plus, he doesn't even tell you what he's looking for! He has bizarre practices like calling a final paper a ""take home exam"" and distribution an insanely difficult topic 4 days before it's due. It's a paper...why does he have to add extra stress to student's lives by only giving them 4 days to work on it!!!! To top it off, his TAs were worthless. One had no personality what so ever and the other spoke like a 13 year old valley girl. Neither one was truly helpful when I approached with questions and one even admitted that she wasn't completely sure what the professor was looking for in a certain assignment, that she was grading! Overall, this was just one of those weird classes that I'm sorry I took. It is completely useless information and the professor, despite appearing approachable, is arrogant and odd. I left on the last day feeling like I never wanted to hear a world about psychological anthropology ever again. Way to go prof and TAs! They made me happy I'm graduating this year and never have to go through a class like this again."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A+,"I really liked this class and I found it to be really interesting. There are two papers (4-5 pages) and they were straight forward and she gives you exactly what she wants to be on there. She even gives you the exact outline she wants it in. The tests are a midterm and a final. They were fairly easy if you pay attention and take notes in class because most of the material comes from the lectures. You will be fine as long as you study the night before or even 2 nights before. Make sure to memorize some important dates and have a good grasp on the timeline. There were a lot of readings, I did not do them and I was fine because she goes over the main ideas in class. I really liked my TA, he made the discussions worth going to and he really knew his stuff! So if you have an opportunity to, pick Jaimie Vela as your TA. Also there is an opportunity for extra credit which can boost your overall grade 5% so do that ASAP because that really helps."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A,"monica is by far an amazing professor, she is both engaging and passionate about what she does and that shows in her lectures, that being said, you don't have to go to them, they're bruincasted, furthermore, DONT BUY THE TEXTBOOK, its not necessary. do the extra credit, it's very easy and honestly at least a bit interesting, the essays are straightforward and she attempts to make them interesting topics and whatnot and to some extent they are. she gives you a template and such and if you get it checked by the TA's you're practically guaranteed an A on those. anyways its a great GE and an easy one. strongly recommend"
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,N/A,"Don’t listen to any of the terrible reviews below. Monica is a great professor. Archaeology is not an interesting topic for me personally, but Monica tries her best to make it digestible. The readings are okay (if you choose to do them, not necessary). Although I will admit that the grading among TAs is variable for the papers, doing the 5% extra credit is enough of a HUGE boost to outweigh any of the damage a bad TA does. If you don’t know which GE you want to take, take this one!"
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A," I would personally HIGHLY recommend this class. I ended up with an A after not doing the extra credit (which is literally a 5% final grade boost if you do it early enough) and sleeping through a discussion section, which was a 1.5% hit to my grade. In general, I would definitely recommend taking this course if you need a GE (or are forced to for your major). The tests/papers were relatively easy for me, and you have a huge cushion for your grade in the discussion participation and extra credit.  Some key pieces of information: -The grading distribution consists of 15% discussion participation+attendance, 20% the midterm, 20% paper 1, 20% paper 2, and 25% the final. There's also the extra credit. If you're a poor test-taker, you can make up for it with your papers and vice versa. The extra credit is also insanely valuable but involves traveling to a museum a decent drive from campus, which is why I didn't do it. -Lectures are broadcasted. You don't have to go to a single lecture if you don't want to (although I would recommend it a week or so after your papers, so you can pick yours up). They were at times boring, but the professor tried her best to make it interesting. They were very clear, and the information was conveyed well. I was never really confused by her lectures. -The ""textbook"" (it was really just a short book) can be found online for free. I did not do a single reading and was fine. There are some questions pertaining to the readings on the test, but most of the time, the questions were over articles (which were covered in lecture anyway). I'd say do the readings if they aren't articles, but otherwise don't waste your time (since the material will be covered the next day in lecture). I think there was a total of 1-2 questions on both the midterm and final where I thought to myself ""if I read, I would know this."" -Both the midterm and the final were only multiple choice (A through E). The midterm was 50 questions, and the final was 75 questions. I got a 94% on the midterm and an 88% on the final with minimal studying. Watch the lectures while taking notes on them, and you should be fine. It was somewhat date-intensive (particularly for empires/civilizations and their key developments), but it was mostly conceptual with some minor memorization. -The papers were graded by your TA, which means that you may get graded harder depending on who you get. I had Espinoza for my TA, and he seemed to grade very reasonably. That being said, I found the papers very doable (I got an 86% on the first one and a 100% on the second one). Make sure you're very detailed with a lot of specific facts from the articles, and use in-text citations when you do! The prompt itself is kinda weird (there's an overall comparison of two articles, and then you have to answer 3 questions), but make sure it flows nicely. A decent chunk of your grade is your intro/conclusion and overall writing style.  As I said before, if you need a GE, I would highly recommend this class. It was easy for me and very low-stress, which meant I could focus on the classes for my major. If you do decently on the tests/papers, show up to discussion, and do the extra credit, you'll definitely get a very good grade."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A,"Took this class fall 2019 as an incoming freshman and it was super manageable. Prof. Smith was nice and you could tell she genuinely cared about the topic and her students. Honestly lecture could be a bit dull at times, especially towards the end of the quarter, but it wasn't too bad. My favorite part of the class was probably the reading; she teaches alongside Lieberman's book, The Story of the Human Body, which is genuinely fascinating and very well written. My TA, Ulises Espinoza, was sub par (showed up to discussion late, didn't respond to emails, was kind of argumentative towards students), but discussion wasn't a big deal and I still enjoyed the class. Essay prompts were confusing and somewhat unrelated to class topics which was frustrating, but if you're an ok writer you'll get by. Midterm and Final are definitely a grade booster, just make sure to make a timeline and memorize dates even if Prof. Smith says you don't have to. Overall, if you're at all interested in anthro and archaeology this class is relatively interesting and a good GPA boost."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A,"Honestly the negative reviews below are not super accurate. I was in a groupme for the class that had a lot of people complaining about how hard everything was and there was this fourth year anthropology student who was always complaining which made no sense. I simply took notes on the slides in class (even though I wasn't really paying attention), studied them the night or two before the midterm and final, and I got an A. Essays were annoying, and the format isn't MLA so be careful because I lost a bunch of points on quoting in MLA, not the classes desired format, however besides that, I felt they were graded pretty easily. Overall the second half of the class wasn't super interesting to me, but the first half was. The extra credit was fun to do and was worth 5%. Not a super easy class but not that difficult."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A+,"I took Anthro 2 as a GE my first quarter at UCLA. I had no idea what to expect, but I'd say this was such a nice ease into college life. The lectures are organized so well: each lecture begins with a summary of the previous lecture so that helps with repetition of the material and Professor Smith is very engaging and clear with her presentations. As for the workload, there were readings assigned that correlate to the lectures so I'd read them in advance of class just so I could be exposed to the material before Smith re-explained it better (however, you could also read the readings after lecture). The class is organized so there's two papers, 1 midterm and the final. Discussions are mandatory, but you can miss one. I found that discussions weren't too helpful for understanding the material, but they were fun nonetheless and my TA helped soothe our fears regarding the papers. TL;DR Take this class. The material is very interesting and Professor Smith explains it very well. There's an extra credit assignment worth up to 5% and the midterm and final were both very easy as long as you show up to class."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A,"As a person who had never taken an anthropology/archaeology class before, I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed this class. The professor is an engaging lecturer and follows the slides so it's not hard to keep up. There are weekly readings but you don't really have to read every single one since she goes over them in lecture. There were two essays that were fairly easy, and a third one for extra credit. The midterm and final are both multiple choice. You'll do fine on them if you pay attention in lecture and have a grasp of the overall timeline."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A,"A lot of your grade depends on your TA, as they are the ones who will be grading your paper. The helpful thing to do is to go into office hours and have your TA read over your paper before turning it in. This was, they'll tell you what you want. Do the extra credit ASAP, you can get a boost of 5%. Overall, the midterm and finals are super easy.  Both are multiple choice."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A+,"This class is an easy A if you do the extra credit as early as possible. You can get up to 5% of extra credit for visiting a museum and writing a reflection. The reflection doesn't have to be a good essay, just show her that you went there and give some thoughts about it. Professor Smith is very funny. Her lectures are engaging. You don't really need to talk during discussions, you just need to be there. My TA often let us out early. The readings are too much. But you would probably be fine even if you don't read them because she goes over the main ideas of each reading in lectures. She would not test you the details on midterms and finals. But I would suggest reading Liberman because there were some specific questions on the tests. The two papers (each 4-5 pages) were stressful to me. I hate writing and I procrastinate a lot. But I made it to TA's office hour before due dates, which were really helpful. The grades of the papers kind of depend on your TA. My TA was super chill (Ulises). So I did fine. If you don't have a great TA, go to your TA's OH several times and revise your paper the way he/she wants.The tests are super easy. You just need to pay attention to every lecture and take notes. (BTW, every lecture is bruincasted, so technically you don't need to go to class) I found making a timeline table very useful. I would recommend this class to anyone who wants an easy A! Remember to do the extra credit ASAP!"
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A+,"Overall, Anthro 2 was my easiest class this quarter, and I took it as a GE. The class is graded based on 2 essays (20% each), 1 midterm (20%), discussion participation (15%), and a final (25%). There is also extra  credit for up to 5% of your final grade. Monica is a very enthusiastic and engaging lecturer in my opinion, and she provided slides to complement her speaking. Realistically, if you copy down her slides' bullet points you should have all the material you need to succeed in the class. She provides a few bullet points at the beginning of each lecture to review the previous one, which I used as a study guide for exams. Both the midterm and final were multiple choice, and in my opinion, extremely easy. All I did to study was read my lecture notes and focus on the review bullet points the day before and received A's on both exams. Plus, the lectures are all Bruincasted, so that was awesome. As for the assigned reading, I actually did all of it, but you really don't have to. Doing all of the reading can take a while, so I really don't know if it was worth it. She goes over the important points from each reading during lecture, so as long as you are familiar with those, you should be set.The essays in the class were also fair in my opinion. Monica tells you the format she wants (it's a basically a compare and contrast), and encourages you to have your TAs look at your rough drafts. I personally wrote both the day before they were due (she gives the prompts 2 weeks before the due date), did not have my TA (Eden) proof either of them, and got A's on both.The extra credit required you to visit a nearby museum and answer a few questions about it in an essay format. The visit took my probably 20 minutes to gather the information, so it's relatively simple. If you do it earlier, it counts for more of your grade. Overall, this class is great for an easy, low-workload GE, and I highly recommend taking it!"
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A+,"Overall, this class was pretty good. Monica tries to lighten up the lectures on a pretty boring topic with the occasional joke and the lectures are bruincasted for when you really don't want to go to class. Also, you never have to do the assigned reading to get all necessary information which is great. The TA grading was pretty uneven for the two papers, so try to get Jaime Vela if possible. The midterm and final are both multiple choice and VERY easy. She also offers up to 5% extra credit, so I actually ended with over 100% in the class. Overall this was a fine class, not a super interesting topic but we love Monica and it's an easy GE."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,C," hard to imagine how I could attend every lecture, participate in every discussion, and study very thoroughly for the final and end up with a such a bad grade.  don't expect the professor to answer your emails. do expect this to be another GE that should be easy but is graded ridiculously by TAs who seem to have a problem with every single person in your discussion section. don't expect that your hard work will pay off in this class. if you're already enrolled in this class, well, good luck Charlie."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,F,"If u think it is a easy GE, do not take it. If u dont have interest in anthropology or archaeology, do not take it bc it will be a disaster. The stuff was so boring and  made me fall asleep.  i went to lectures most of the time but i did not learn anything more than my friend who seldom went attend class. The essays were graded harshly and although TA promised to help review the first draft, he got impatient and said that was all i can help by throwing me two sentences which were not constructive suggestions. Plus i got points distracted for both papers for the APA format. I swear that i checked the format online and even asked people in the writing center and did that following instructions carefully.  I really wonder what is the TA's problem."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,N/A,"The essays in this class are graded very subjectively by the TA's and Monica didn't care much when this concern was brought up by multiple classmates. It is helpful to bring your rough draft to your TA and get feedback. Make sure to memorize important dates for the midterm and the final. Some midterm questions are reused on the final, so review them. Most if the material comes from lectures, with a little bit from the weekly readings. Overall, not the easiest GE if your TA is a harsh grader."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,N/A,"As a fourth year anthro major, I thought taking this class would be a breeze. Unfortunately that wasn’t the case.There was 2 papers, a midterm, and final.The grades I received did not reflect on my investment and work I put in for this class.The TA’s graded their sections and the essays were graded very subjectively and who you had as a TA affected your overall performance. ( I had Eden)This is the first class at UCLA where I had received lower than a B on a paper so I was very shocked to see my performance on the papers.For the exams, they were way too specific and some questions did not reflect on the class. I had a hard as well on the exams.Overall, do not recommend to take this class unless it is required. Welp. I only have one quarter left... If I don’t pass, that’s another story.I hope professors and TA’s take these evaluations in consideration."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A+," Overall this class was extremely easy, but I attribute that to my TA Jewell rather than Prof. Smith. While Smith's lectures were somewhat engaging and useful, she tends to stray off topic and going into a lot of detail about her own work rather than the material being covered, which is interesting I guess if you're into archaeology. She responds to emails and office hours pretty diligently, but tbh isn't the most helpful.  Grades are based on 4 papers with an optional 5th paper that takes the grade of the previous papers. Each essay is about 750 words long, and honestly, you can probably knock them out within 2-3 hours if you skim the readings and lecture recordings. Each paper is 20% of your grade, and the discussion grade (last 20%) is mostly based on attendance, but you end up sharing and contributing to the discussions naturally.  I would suggest everyone at UCLA take this course as a GPA booster, as a respite from other classes with heavier workloads, or just in general, as I personally consider this the easiest course I've taken so far, but your grades are largely determined on your TA, which I know could be hit or miss."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A,"I overall thought this class was super interesting and easy. The class criteria were clear and simple and our grades were completely based on our composition of 4 short papers. Each paper was 750 words and corresponded with assigned readings and lectures. We were allowed to complete an optional final (which was a 5th paper) that would replace our lowest score on any previous paper. The discussion sections were also mandatory, but only have an extremely insignificant amount of weight on final grades. The lectures themselves included compelling materials but were sometimes very dry and boring. I often found myself falling asleep in class simply because the energy in the room was dry and unengaging. Nonetheless, if writing comes easy to you, I highly recommend this class. It's an easy A for anyone who can write a basic response to research papers and has an interest in archaeology or anthropology."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A, discussion required4 papers (all 750 words) optional final paper (20%) - extra credit (can only help your grade)  overall: boring class but it is a relatively EZ GE only if you have a good TA.
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A+,"I took this class as prep for the Anthro minor, but I highly recommend if you're looking for a chill GE! Prof. Smith does her best to make the material (which can be dull, at times) super engaging. She's an amazing lecturer with mad jokes. The fact that this class was asynchronous with pre-recorded lectures made it super easy to catch up at all times. The grade breakdown is 20% each for four papers with an extra 20% from participating in section. There is no mandatory midterm and final! The essays are very straightforward and Prof. Smith basically outlines exactly how she wants you to write them. They're only 2 page essays, as well. As for section, it is mandatory but Prof. Smith does her best to make it fun with little show-and-tell type ways to get participation points.  Finally, she offers an extra credit paper on some fun archaeology movie (Indiana Jones, The Dig, etc.) AND an extra credit final to replace up to TWO paper grades! The best part of this class was that the final mandatory paper was due week 8, so I could check out those last two weeks lol."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,F," To be honest, this is not an easy A GE. I changed to PNP while at last I got 93/100 which is an A...... During covid, the final grades break down to four papers and discussion participation grade. Some of those papers had very tricky prompts, which lots of students deviate from what professor Smith and the TAs expected, which will possibly give you the grades you didn't intend.  Professor Smith is the most interesting professor and the best lecturer I've ever met. Her lectures were so intriguing and the workload is not that heavy. I personally like the contents of this course and probably will take other courses of her in the future. Taking her class will definitely help you learn something interesting about anthropology! Overall, Professor Smith's lectures are awesome and the workload is not that heavy. However, the grading of the papers and the prompts of the paper can be tricky, which means this class is not an EASY A class, especially for STEM students like me. In order to write great papers and get an A in the end, you'll have to make some effort, can't miss the lectures and will have to finish the readings."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A+,"An interesting and easy GE! We write a 750-word essay every two weeks and if you put enough sources in each paragraph of your paper, you'll most likely do well."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A+," Absolutely loved this class with Professor Smith. Lectures were asynchronous and uploaded every lecture day, while discussions were in-person and mandatory for participation (one discussion grade is dropped). I think this class was run really differently this quarter, so my feedback might not be so helpful.  The discussion portion is worth 20% of your grade, and the rest is divided up among four essays, which were due every two weeks in the course.  Professor Smith is a really engaging lecturer, I honestly didn't know much or care about archaeology before this class, but I learned a ton and really enjoyed the course. Discussions are fun and collaboration based, we discussed some prompt every week that related to course content.  For essays, there's a ton of room to improve your grade if you did bad in the beginning, there's an extra credit essay that can replace one of your essay grades, and there's also an optional final (also essay) that can replace another one. There's no makeups for discussion, so I'd make sure to go.  Essays are a little open-ended in the prompts, which can be challenging, but I really enjoyed writing them. The rubric is not really handed out so it can be a bit ambiguous at times, but go to the professor's office hours and your TA's as well. One tip is that be sure to include as many of the written text sources as possible, they are grading on whether or not you can synthesize information from the class, not just rewriting the lecture. All in all, great class!"
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A," Took this class for my last GE and I highly recommend it if you're looking for something easy. Class was entirely recorded with a weekly discussion section (If you can get Britt Florkiewicz as your TA, DO IT. She is without a doubt the best TA I have ever had, truly a wonderful person.) if you participated once, even in the chat, you got full participation points for that section. Aside from the participation grade, which made up 20%, the other 80% was made up entirely of essay grades. There were 4 essays, only 750 words, covering the topics we had gone over in the last week and a half or so. Graded quite leniently. There's an optional final and an optional extra credit assignment. Incredibly easy to get a good grade in the class. I will say, because everything except for the discussion is online, it did feel very impersonal and there is definitely no relationship built between you and the professor or any other students."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A+,"Dr. Smith is one of the cutest and kindest professors I've met <3 Her lectures are informative, organized, and she really cares about her students. This is a great GE class to take and if you put efforts into studying the course materials and spending time on the essays, you will do well."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,F," DO THE EXTRA CREDIT. It's like 5% of your grade and it's so easy and she's probably gonna give you full credit. If you gotta take this class, then do the extra credit. Okay, now that I've said that... I came into this class thinking I was interested in archeology but very soon found out I was not. This class was basically a history class. The lectures were incredibly boring and Monica speaks insanely slow and uninterestingly. We briefly talked about how archeology works but mostly it was such social anthropology and ancient human stuff. Also, a lot of people thought this class would talk about fossils and stuff but it's just human bones, beads, and pottery.  Also, the paper is graded insanely and unnecessarily hard and will tank your grade, so I changed it to a P/NP class."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A,"Grade breakdown: 15% discussion participation, 20% midterm, 40% two papers, 25% final. Discussion was honestly pretty fun and my TA (ulysses) made it easy to participate. This class was pretty boring though, and overall I never want to take an archaeology or anthropology class again. The papers in this class absolutely demolished me. I felt like every fiber of my being was being ripped to shreds as I had to write them. The citations on the papers are REALLY important. They will knock you a whole letter grade. Seriously, have a rough draft for the TA's to look over before you turn it in because the grading on the essays has absolutely no rubric and is completely up to the TA. I got a 40/50 on my first paper and 50/50 on my second paper, but even though my scores were good my morale was super low and I absolutely despised writing those papers. The midterm was the easiest thing ever if you watched the lecture (which is bruincasted!!!!), and the final was a little harder but still pretty easy. She offers up to 5% extra credit which, in my opinion, is really vital in securing an A in the class. I wouldn't take the professor again because honestly, I thought the class was so boring and I was never excited to come to it, but I can't tell if it's because of the professor or the content. If you're just fulfilling a GE then please just find another one."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A+," 1) GRADING: midterm 1 (20%) paper 1 (20%) paper 2 (20%) discussion participation (15%) final (25%) + up to 5% extra credit from visiting a museum 2) MIDTERM/FINAL: all MC, pretty straightforward if you attended lecture and took notes. helps to make a timeline of events. she reuses some midterm questions on the final. i got B+ on both by just studying a couple hours the night before 3) PAPERS: your TA grades your paper, so difficulty will be up to them. For both papers, you have to read two articles, summarize them, compare and contrast them, and answer 3 questions using them 4) HOMEWORK: reading due every lecture (3x wk). they were really long :( you can probably get away wo reading them but sometimes specific questions pop up on exams 5) LECTURES: prof is a good lecturer, tries to add humor into it. they're also bruincasted 6) TAs: I had Jamie Vela, and he was super chill. I probably wouldn't have done as well on the papers if another TA was grading them."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A+,"This was the first GE I took at UCLA and I was very happy with the class. All the information that you need to know comes from her lectures which are Bruincasted. There are two papers which are compare/contrast. The best way to do well on these papers is to go to office hours and have your TA check them before. For the midterm and final, the questions are memorization based and you will need to know a few key dates. There is extra credit which can add up to 5% to your grade. With each lecture there is an associated reading, but you only need to know what she goes over in class. DISCLAIMER: This class does not cover content regarding dinosaurs and there is very little about Egypt/mummies. Overall, I thought the material would be more interesting, but it was still a good, easy history class."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A,"I personally loved taking this class with Professor Smith, but I know many people who did not like it. The class was very heavily reading based, the lectures are always based upon the reading that was assigned for that day. Her exams are very straightforward, the tests are essentially ""what is in your notebook"", literally nearly every question on the exam is in your notebook so if you study it religiously you'll be fine. We had two essays, neither of which were particularly difficult, and the TAs will move their office hours around to make themselves as available to help as possible. She uses Bruincast and there is no participation points in lecture, which makes being absent a little easier, but I do strongly suggest actually using Bruincast to catch up on missed lectures because of the exams. Overall, I would definitely recommend this class to other students, especially if you don't have an issue with reading."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A,"I did not enjoy this class at all, and it made me hate archaeology, which I have continued to dislike from upper div classes. This class was so boring, hard to focus in, and the material was not made more interesting. Expectations were vague. I do not recommend it. Wait for a professor with better reviews and take it from them!"
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A-,"Overall, this was a good class. Professor Smith was clear with assignments and grading. Lectures were sometimes dry, but overall the content was interesting (at least to me). Discussion sections were mandatory, but I think I learned the most insightful information there. Tests were easy if you went to lectures, paid attention, and read class material. Papers were graded somewhat harshly, but Smith offers extra credit that really helped my grade. Overall, this GE was on the easier side and I would definitely recommend it to others."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A,"I loved this class, which made me add an Anthro minor. Her class is very interesting and her tests are very easy if you pay attention in class and read. She also gives you two papers, where she (and her TAs) grades them very harsh, but with the extra credit she provides, you can easily bump your grade up to five percent."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"This class is not hard. If you're a freshman it may be a bit difficult because of the amount of reading, but not much. She assigns two essays which are very straightforward. She gives a detailed prompts with exactly what she wants in the papers. There is a midterm and a final which are both multiple choice.  The midterm was not too hard just pay close attention to the questions. Discussion is mandatory but there are no graded assignments for them. Overall the class is interesting."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,A,"I loved the material in this class but if you're looking for an easy GE this is not it. It is not just a memorize and spit it out on the test type of class. You'll need to study the material and be able to connect the material based on the essay question. She offered extra credit which saved my grade since I'd done poorly on the midterm. For the paper, definitely take your rough drafts to the TAs to have proofread. If you're interested in this I'd say take the class but be prepared for lots of reading and tough exams. It is definitely not an easy GE."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,B+,"Definitely use flashcards for the material of this class since there is a lot to cover.  I find that very useful although other people may vary. There were 3 midterms and no final and all were pretty spaced out. There are readings for the class but I'm pretty sure that you don't need to read all of them since she recaps them in lecture and gives you the gists of it. If however, you have time, it does help. For the paper, it would be in your best interest to see the TA's seeing that they know the rubrics and are the ones grading. Lastly, the final is cumulative but should be easy if you review all the big concepts. This class is basically memory based. If you're good at that, then you should enjoy this class and ace it. Best of luck!"
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,A," I've wanted to take an archaeology class for a while now, so my review might be biased by my interest in the material.  Professor Smith is a very good professor in that she does her best to make sure you have the materials to succeed if you put in the work. Her lectures are very organized and I found them engaging (again I'm interested in the material, though, you have to want to learn about ancient cultures and how ancient people behaved/looked like, etc.). She puts up most of the lecture slides online and Bruincasts all her lectures which is helpful if you miss a few and in reviewing for the midterms and final.  The class was broken down very evenly into: 20% midterm 1, 20% midterm 2, 20% final, 20% paper, and 20% discussion participation. Because of this the final wasn't a huge stress, but you have to go to every discussion if you want that easy 100. Also her tests are cumulative so that's very helpful and definitely makes the tests easier (although I still wouldn't call them easy, they're definitely challenging). All the tests were broken down into 10 mc, 15 short answer, and an essay in the 50 minute class period. It's doable, but a bit tricky.  I recommend making index cards on the big ideas, and definitely DEFINITELY take notes on the bullets she opens every class with on the previous lecture! The 5pg essay was also fairly easy to do well on if you followed the prompt and met with a TA to get feedback. The TA will basically tell you exactly what you're missing or need to do to get a decent grade, so really the essay isn't something to worry about. Also my TA was amazing (Katelyn Bishop) so if you get her you're lucky! Hardest part of the course was the number of readings assigned. There is a reading due for EVERY lecture, and they aren't usually short. On top of my other reading heavy classes this is definitely where I struggled to keep up. Keep in mind you could be spending 10+ hours on the readings alone every week.  Finally, she gives extra credit for the final at the beginning of the quarter. The earlier you hand it in, the more extra points you get on the final. You have to visit one the museums she lists and then write a 3-4 page paper answering a few questions about it. I didn't do it, but I judging by the grade distribution of the final compared to the other tests, it was a really helpful boost.  Overall I would highly recommend the class to anyone with any interest in archaeology or ancient history, or heritage. Otherwise, it might not be the best GE for you to take as it can be a lot of work to keep up with, and the tests can be pretty hard. Sorry for the huge ass review, I just know I was super nervous to take this class, but I had to for my major. Hoping to make it seem less daunting!"
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,Bruh don't take this class.
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,F,"Professor Smith is AMAZING in my opinion. She comes to class every day with a smile, eager to teach. You can tell she loves her job and the subject. She goes above and beyond for her students. The lectures are podcasted, she extends office hours for projects, and she is always at her office hours. she is super nice and easy to talk to, even funny! She is also very organized. The class and tests follow the same routine, and she explains every day what will be talked about, and even reviews from the previous lecture. EVERY. TIME. There is quite a bit of reading to do for this class, and the tests can be a bit tricky. The T.A.s can be vague and kind of unhelpful, but the class and what is expected of you is pretty straightforward. I enjoyed this class very much!"
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,B-,Selling all required books for the class for cheap! Text me at 818-217-5220 if interested
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Interesting classI am selling my textbook The Human Past 2nd edition by Scarre (pretty much same as 3rd) . No notes or highlights, and in mint condition. Text me at (818) 585-4397 I can meet on or around campus. Selling for $20 with price negotiable."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,F,"Professor Smith seems like a genuinely nice lady who is passionate about what she is teaching, but DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.  It is absolutely awful, the TA's are complete savages when they grade.  I literally got a 20/50 on one of the essays and it completely ruined my grade for the class.  You can do as well as you want on the midterm and finals, but the essays will still destroy your grade.  The TA's are not willing to review grades and help the students.  When I tried to go in for help, my TA lowered my grade even further.  I hated this class and I 100% would not recommend taking it as an easy GE.  While Professor Smith is a nice lady, her awkward sense of humor and monotone voice both bored and disgusted me throughout lecture.  I have major regrets about taking this class.  DO NOT TAKE IT I'M SERIOUS."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"I really enjoyed Professor Smith's lectures and the class material was actually interesting.However, the midterm and the final, especially, require mass amounts of memorization that you are responsible to find in the giant book.Also, the 2 papers have potential to ruin a grade. I get A's in other UCLA English classes, but for this GE class my TA would not give me anything higher than a B-. Some TA's are just meticulous and it's obnoxious. That being said, it's a good GE and Smith is a nice professor. I would recommend this class "
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Professor Smith herself is a great lecturer and professor. Anthro 8 is actually interesting and fun because of the way she lectures. She uses some humor coupled with her knowledge on archaeology. The only problem that I had with the class was the 2 research papers. I got a really bad grade on the first one based on the remarks that I got. I improved on the second one however since it was 2 different TAs that graded the papers, I got points taken off of the second paper that were not mentioned as flaws in the first. The papers can really screw your grade over. I got an A on the midterm and the final and did not get an A in the class. But do decent like Bs on the papers, go to lecture and take extensive notes and you should be okay. Not a bad GE to take. "
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A, Overall a very easy class.I was reading some of the reviews and I was initially scared that it would be a difficult class. The key to the class is like everyone has said before memorization.The class is broken down as followed for my quarter.15% Attendance in Discussion20% Midterm25% Final40% Two 5 page papers The exams were really easy. The key to getting an A in this class is to go to lecture and take good notes. That and skimming through the gigantic textbook. For the textbook just read each box about key sites and write its location and one to two important things from it. For the papers make sure you go to the TA's office hours at least twice for each draft. This will ensure you get a high B or an A. Otherwise they will massacre your writing.I ended up getting an A! Take the class with Smith. Easy and she ties the history of the world down to a few common themes. It does help if you have taken Anthro 7 before but not by a lot.
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Class is not difficult as long as you attend lecture, write down all sites mentioned and memorize all of them.  At least memorize the location of the sites, that will help a lot for the test.  There is a midterm, final (both multiple choice) and two 4-5 pg. papers.  She is always asking you to go to her office hours and explains things well.  It is also a nice bonues that she has a podcast of her lectures.  Memorization is key in this class.  If you can do that then you'll do well."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"something about her voice bothered the heck out of me...so monotone. she's a nice lady but i just got annoyed..exams were mostly lecture based.  i did no reading only studied 1/2 days before the midterm and final but literally memorized every detail, i'm a bio major so when i mean memorrize it all I MEAN IT. did no reading, paper was graded harshly a shocking C that screwed up my grade. don't take it unless you're anthro major. "
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"She's a great teacher who loves her job and actually wants to teach!  She communicates everything in her lectures very clearly, she's friendly, helpful with any question you might have, and eager to interact with her students, even in large lecture classes.  Her tests are straight forward, and she seems to pull most of her material from the lectures and key site specific information.  I would highly recommend Professor Smith!"
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Professor Smith was a great lecturer in that she didn't just read off of the slides, which really forces you to pay attention and take notes. Her tests were easy (straight from lecture notes) and discussions were relaxed and interesting for a GE class. She always responded to my e-mail questions and never acted harsh or condescending towards me. Oh yeah, the paper topics were pretty interesting too! Archaeology IMO is not really an exciting subject, but Prof. Smith makes it worth going to class, for the most part (which is impressive considering that most of the GE classes I've taken have just been incredibly boring...)"
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Course Taken: Anthro 8Dr. Smith was such a great speaker and so passionate about the subject, it made the lectures extremely interesting. Although the focus of Anthro 8 is very broad--covering millions of years of history in ten weeks--it is doable. The most important thing you need to do for this class is to go to lecture. In the beginning of each lecture, she will give you a summary of what she talked about in the previous lecture. STUDY THOSE for the midterm and final. I would say 90% of her exams are solely based on lecture notes. The readings were way too dense--I gave up reading after the midterm and still did very well in the class. However, she does like to ask questions about some random sites mentioned in the reading. I would suggest to read the summary at the end of each chapter--they give you a nice overview of the chapter and a review of what Dr. Smith talked about in lecture. Also, there were orange boxes every few pages or so in the readings that highlight specific sites or information. Make sure you read those. Those random questions about the readings I was talking about earlier are mostly from those orange boxes. The two papers were fairly easy--just answer the questions given for the topic in the prompt and you will do fine. Go to Dr. Smith or the TA's office hours and have them revise your papers--it really helps you get an idea of what they're looking for on the papers. The discussion sections are rather useless to this class, except for the handouts that the TA gives you. You need to know the material on those for the exams. Otherwise, I really recommend this class. Although we didn't have enough time to go into the smallest details for the different empires (that would've been interesting), it gave us a nice overview of archaeology and what it's all about. In addition, if you're looking for an easy and interesting GE, this is the one. Good luck.  "
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Professor Smith is very passionate about what she does. She is a great lecturer and is always willing to help. Definitely go to lectures as much as you can; it helps a lot for the exams. As long as you read text boxes that the book highlights, you should be able to do very well. As for the papers, definitely go to the TAs and Professor with your rough draft. It will help a lot and get an idea of what they are looking for during grading. The discussion session are not so helpful except the handouts, which you might want to memorize. "
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"This GE was a breeze. Smith's lectures were interesting, provided you actually have an interest in human civilizations and the evolution of mankind in the first place. She tries to tie up each lecture with a nice conclusion and seemed genuinely passionate about what she lectures. I missed one question on the midterm--it felt like I was in high school again, where multiple choice tests are straightforward and simple. As long as you go to lecture and take thorough notes, you should do fine, because her tests are mostly lecture-based. The textbook is supplemental, in my opinion. She assigns two 5 page papers, but they were straightforward to do, as long as you cover all the bases of the prompt. The final included questions from the midterm and was very doable. I finished mine in less than 30 minutes. But the discussion sections are totally useless, irrelevant and not well-connected to her lectures."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,She is a great teacher. Lectures make the bulk of the exams so go and take notes. The reading is supplemental and a bit dense. I stopped reading after the second week. Got an A. 
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"This class is a very very hard GE, since the class is too broad. The reading is seriously way too dense and it is impossible to memorize all the concepts in the readings.The readings by itself is way too much. The class is cumulative(lectures + readings) which make studying for this class insane. For me, the lecture and readings were totally different. I think this was because the professor is giving her own opinions about the topic. Anyways, avoid this GE if possible don't get fooled by the interesting name or you think it is easy. I'm telling you upfront, this is not worth the stress, hair pulling,or loss of sleep.    "
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Her lectures were too dry and the focus of Anthro 8 was too broad. She told us to consider anything 2paragraphs or more important, expected us to read a large amount of dense information and execute it well on the exam. the impossibility of the class was that TA's were unresourceful--discussions were a joke and useless to the class and exams. This was not an easy GE to fulfill."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"I am a diligent student and I can definitely tell you she is among the worst of the Anthro professors.  Her lectures are dry and she never gave her TA's access to the students.  I wonder why.  As for going to all her lectures - it does not help.  She gives too much reading and then does not tell you what is imp. (or what to focus on).  ""Anything that is mentioned more than twice or takes up two paragraphs"" is not focused enough! You end up trying to remember everything.  Did not have any understanding/patience for students who sought her help.  She just gave what little help was needed so she 'seemed' available for her students.  Awful!"
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"I took this as one of my first classes at UCLA and i loved it! I thought she was really interesting, and i thought the class was really easy. the trick to all her tests is you have to go to lecture. If you're the kind of person who skips lecture this isn't the class for you. i went to lecture and the tests were all basic info from lectures, so i got an A, but a friend of mine never went to class and got a D. The readings are kindof important, but you could not do them and still get a good grade in the class. overall, i would definitely recommend her."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Dr. Smith was very passionate about and engaged in her work. She was pretty interesting in lecture, but assigns a ton of reading from a really boring textbook. The midterm was pretty easy, but totally throws you off when it comes to the final. The final was IMPOSSIBLE. Overall, an okay class.. if you need to get a GE out of the way it's easily passable."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Professor Smith is a very good professor and teacher. I genuinely felt that she cared a lot about the students and our learning. Archaeology is a dense subject, and while there was loads and loads of reading, she managed to break it down pretty well for the lectures. The tests were so-so... I got a B- on the midterm, mid-range As on the papers, and thought I bombed the final, but ended up with a B+ in the class, which wasn't too bad considering it was my first quarter at UCLA. In retrospect, I could've worked harder and probably gotten an A. Overall, I'd say this course is tough but enjoyable, and Professor Smith is truly one of UCLA's best. I'd take this course again in a minute."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Going to the lectures was especially helpful since the textbook was packed with (untested) information.  Her lectures can be a bit monotonous but it's very clear and the material is interesting if you like history and science.  Memorization is quite critical for your grade, but nothing a few flash cards won't fix.  I went to a few of Professor Smith's office hours and she was very nice and helpful.  One last thing:  keep up with the readings!"
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"I am a science major at UCLA and I took Smith's Anthro 8 class as a prerequisite for my minor in Anthropology. I have to say that she is probobly one of the best teachers I have had at UCLA thus far and I am a sophomore. Do NOT listen to other reviewers and believe that she is an approachable, amiable teacher who truly cares about the plight of the studesnt if you would just go to her OH. Honestly I thought she condensed all of world history pretty well and honestly--for these classes it does take memorization, and if you are trying to get around it don't take this class because thats the only way you will get an A. The people who are just lazy will take her and call her the worst teacher possible because they probobly didn't even go to class or read the material. For me however, I thought the tests were REALLY fair--missed one or two questions each--(compared to science classes)--and lectures were very interesting if you were genuinely interested in the material. Hope this helps."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A," Professor Smith must be among the worst teachers I have ever had in my entire academic career, and probably THE WORST professor I have had at UCLA so far.  The way she conducts a class is not conducive to a good learning environment.  Her lectures are incredibly dry and uninformative.  She mentions many obscure names yet does not write much information up on the overheads, and then expects you to recognize and memorize them for the midterm and final.   In addition, she speaks to the class as if we are children.  She repeats the same SIMPLE concepts, much of which are just plain common sense, over and over again, and even has us fill in the blanks for her.  Also, when she feels a bit more expressive, she uses this voice to sound more dignified \361 \354I am Hammurabi!!!\356 \361 and continues to aggravate and irritate the students even more.  By this time, if you have maintained your sanity and have not left her classroom, you begin to dose off because you realize that you are learning absolutely nothing and should have just read the book instead.  Furthermore, her tests do not seem to cover many of the overreaching concepts of the class and only focused on ludicrous detail.  Moreover, she thought that a good studying technique would have been to \354use your syllabus.\356  Well, thank you Professor Smith, that really narrows it down.  She also grades the essays really harshly; she says \354summarize the article\356 in the prompt and then marks you down for summarizing!  You better hope that one of the TAs grades your\355s! Also, Professor Smith refuses to give the TAs too much information about the tests beforehand, making it incredibly difficult for them to prepare the students for the exam.  Although most of my learning occurred in the discussions, I still feel that the sections could have been designed to be more conducive to the \354material\356 presented in lectures. She has made the class so unenjoyable that I have started to hate everything about the it, even the classroom; walking by Fowler Museum sends shivers down my spine.  DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN EASY GE!  Only take it with Professor Smith if you absolutely have to.  And don\355t let the course description mislead you; you do not actually get to go to a dig site!  "
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A," Dr. Smith's lectures are generally interesting and super easy to follow. Pay attention, take good notes, you will be tested on EVERYTHING. Her anth 8 class is pretty difficult. She claims there is no curve, but then offers extra credit. I got a C+ on the midterm, studied like I've never studied before and ended up with an A+ in the class (as did many other people I spoke with). I think the key to her class is talking to her and your TA on a regular basis. They are ALWAYS available. Also- talk to each of the four TAs, you never know who will grade your paper. She told me herself that they look at each person individually and assign them a grade at the end of the quarter. If they know you are trying they will help you out. Make sure to memorize everything. She tests on the very very specific and of course everything you decided wasn't important enough to waste time studying, ie dates, dates of dating techniques, locations of fossil artifacts... You are not given nearly enough time for the midterm, so if time gets close use bullets (they won't tell you beforehand but the people that did that got full credit). Also- be very specific in your essay answers, include dates and brain sizes and locations.  This is not an easy A GE course. Take it if you need it for the major. It's enjoyable if you keep up."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"DO NOT TAKE HER... UNLESS YOU WANT TO SUFFER! Although it was an interesting class from which I learned an emmence amount of material I think that her grading on the tests was not fair at all. Her questions were not clear and the grade you recieve on the tests are basically determined by which T.A you have. Save yourself the heartbreak of getting a horrible grade despite your hard work! To her credit however, she was willing to regrade and add a few points here and there but it was not worth all the trouble!"
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!  Although it seems like an easy GE, keep in mind that the class is NOT curved and the professor and the TA's massacre your essay.  Your success in the midterm and final depend on your memorization skills.  So unless you live and breathe anthropology, stay away from this class."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Prof. Smith is a tough but fair grader. Her grading scheme was very nit picky, but she tells you exactly what she's looking for (with the exception of some vague short answer questions on the midterm). As long as you follow her formatting and answer all the questions on the guided research papers (30% of your grade) you'll do well. As for the midterm/final, be sure to be detailed in your short answer (e.g. if it's worth 8 points each, you better put down 8 factoids). As for lectures, Prof. Smith's soothing voice made it hard to stay awake sometimes, but her lectures were very organized and she always provides you with a summary of her previous lecture. Overall, the course covered a broad amount of material, but Smith's organized approach makes the class a good intro course."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Anthro 8 was a nice introductory class. Sure, the material did not go in-depth, but that's expected of a class that covers several million years of pre-history. Sometimes the lectures can be a bit hard to stay awake through, but it's not that bad. The only real downside of her course were the midterm and final -- the multiple choice and fill-in-the blank portions covered varying specifics that could be easily skipped over when studying. The long-answer portion of her tests are pretty harshly graded, you need to make sure you write down every possible thing you remember about the subject. The guide research papers are straightforward, and are fairly graded. There's a lot of memorization involved, so if you want a supremely easy GE you might want to look elsewhere."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"I would not recommend this class to others. I personally hated it. The material covered in this class is way too broad-- from several million years ago until now. There was so much material packed into this one course that it was not possible to fully appreciate each society and to go more indepth into it. You basically just have to memorize many things about MANY different things. Her exams (a combination of multiple choice, fill-in-the-balnk, and short answer questions) consisted of some really trivial multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank questions. She also grades the short answer part of her exams in a very detailed manner so that full marks are difficult to achive. The one part of her class that was relatively simple were the term papers. In addition, her lectures are really boring...so much that I would fall asleep. If you need to fulfill a GE, there are many less painful, less frustrating, and less boring ways of fulfilling it."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"I was a first quarter freshman looking for an easy GE, anthro 8 was my answer. The class is about as interesting as a class can get and prof Smith is about as interesting as a teacher as youll get. She has an awesome voice and is a happy woman as far as I can tell and that rubs off a lot on her class lectures, which are interesting enough that I never fell asleep in them. There is reading, but very minimal, two papers a quarter which are ""guided"" [that means half the research is done for you], and an easy midterm/final if you take halfway decent notes. If you want a good class thats also kick back, anthro 8 with smith is for you."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Monica Smith was a great class for introuductory purposes. Very well structured, very well organized. I did learn lots in this class. However, I do know that this is a hit and miss kind of thing. A lot of people HATED this class, for one reason or another. It could be a little difficult to try and keep up with some of the boring material... but what are you expecting? Her paper was relatively easy and broad. However, I heard that when she graded papers, she tore them apart... She generally splits papers with her TAs, it's random... The final and midterm aren't too hard. A lot of memorizing. Good class though."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Prof Smith's lectures were fairly somewhat slow.  It's amazing that she could talk the entire lecture period and not say all that much.  That said, I found much of the material interesting, but often very repetitive.  I guess that's sort of the nature of the beast when you take lower div classes - their generality leads to heavy repetition.  I actually did not do as well as I thought I would in the class, although the effort I put in was fairly minimal.  Not a bad teacher for a GE course, but if Anthro is your major you might look for a bigger challenge."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Dr.Smith made extra office hours in the dorms.. she is very concerned and I truly loved her lectures.  Her test are very fair despite a few meaningless and trivial multiple choice questions, but otherwise, her class is enjoyable and the work pace is very manageable."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"I feel asleep in every class but managed to get a B+.  It did help that I had prior knowledge from taking Anthro 7.  Also my TA was extremely lenient and easy. Monica, I heard from others, is a difficult grader with the essays."
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A," Dr. Smith treats her students as though they are in elementary school, by asking incredibly simple questions multiple times in lecture then waiting through extended periods of silence for answers.  This awkward tactic begins to grate against your nerves by 2nd week and will fully drive you towards insanity by 10th week.  Furthermore, she is the most unyielding, unflexible professor I have ever had at UCLA, as she refuses to consider earnest personal issues that hinder academic performance.  Take her class only if you have the ability to space out for extended periods of time (to avoid the annoyance of the question-silence periods) and plan to never speak with her. This is hardly a bitter post- my grade in the class was an A+- but rather an honest summary of my Anthropology 8 experience.  I, an Anthropology major, refuse to take a class with Dr. Smith again."
Monica L Smith,NA,Fiat Lux Freshman Seminars,ANTHRO 19,F," I really liked my fiat lux (food and culture during pandemics) with Professor Smith. She is really nice, funny, and wholesome, and she always makes an effort to include everyone. The class involves a weekly reading that usually ranges from 4-20 pages (most are between 4-7). They're really interesting, and you definitely don't need to retain all of the information - just an elementary summary understanding will suffice.  Then, in class, she always starts with an intro question like your favorite staple cooking ingredient and goes around the room to share. You will participate in this class, but it's not intimidating at all! She's super understanding and approachable. After the intro question, you just discuss the reading and any current events for the remainder of the 50 minutes. She ends class punctually and sometimes will send additional articles she thinks are cool throughout the week afterwards. Overall, Prof. Smith is an AMAZING anthropologist with lots of cool stories. If you ask her about her experiences, she'll recount some really interesting projects and things she's learned (ask about Asia!). Prof. Smith is also very understanding of mental health and zoom exhaustion. She lets you miss 2 classes and even spent some time on the day before the election talking about mental health resources for us. I would definitely recommend taking the seminar if you want an interesting, low stress class, and take advantage of the discussion time you have!!"
Monica L Smith,NA,Fiat Lux Freshman Seminars,ANTHRO 19,N/A,It was a pretty laid back fiat lux since your grade is just based on class attendance.  Some of the readings were interesting while others were a bore.  Professor Smith is nice although she's not the best discussion facilitator.
Monica L Smith,NA,Cities Past and Present,ANTHRO 112R,N/A,"Cities Past and Present was the best class I have ever taken at UCLA. She is so chill. There were 20 people in the class and we sat around each day and talked about cities- what we thought of them, how they made us feel, why people moved into and out of them, etc etc. We only had two small ethnographies to write, a two question midterm, and a final paper (plus three 10pt, 1 page ec summary papers that would bump your entire grade up by a whole letter grade). The reading was very interesting and the discussions were great. We all laughed a lot and shared our personal feelings. She has a great way of sparking converstaion and asking you to look deeper. Keep in mind, classes are laidback but you still have to do the reading for the exam. Not intensively, but you MUST cite author's names and fieldsites to support your arguments (which she gives to you- along with a study guide). I got an A+ and it's almost impossible not to. One day Prof Smith even brought in Japanese HipHop for us to listen to. Great Professor and very nice lady!"
Monica L Smith,NA,Cities Past and Present,ANTHRO 112R,A+," Dr. Smith is by far the most engaging lecturer I've ever seen. I took it asynchronous so all the lectures were uploaded. Her lectures are so fun and interesting, and she always relates it to current/modern life. As with a lot of anthro classes, she uploads PDF articles on CCLE. Every class day you have 1 reading (except for one week where we had 2 per day). Also, she worked super hard to find really up to date material. We had quite a few readings from 2020-2021 so it was relatable. The grading was 4 essays at 20% each and discussion participation which was another 20%. She offered a no harm extra credit paper half way through. The final was also like a no harm paper, and it was optional, so it's really easy to get a good grade. At the worst, you could write 6 essays, but it's worth the bump. They're 750 words per paper however, so you have to have all your info in a compact space. The TA did the grading and the first paper was pretty harshly critiqued, I got 75% on it, but on the rest I got 95-100%. They were graded so harshly the first time so we know what they expect from us. It may be jarring but I think it's worth it, especially with essentially 2 extra credit opportunities. The discussions were always a fun and interesting conversation as well. Though she did say this class doesn't usually have a discussion section, so I don't know how well this may relate to future classes. Overall, I highly highly recommend this class and Dr. Smith in general. She is an amazing person, professor, and academic. Every reading we had was incredibly interesting and her corresponding lectures were amazing. I cannot recommend this enough!!"
Monica L Smith,NA,Historical Archaeology: American Perspective,ANTHRO M115B,N/A," Pros:*Intelligent*Funny*Very well-organized lectures and good use of slides*Well balanced workload*Extremely straightforward tests Cons:*In upper-divs, expects you to know a lot*In lower-divs, assignments are repetitive Overall: Worth taking her classes. She puts in a lot of effort, has a lot of time in office hours "
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology of South Asia,ANTHRO 116,A,This is my second class with Professor Smith and I love her classes. This class was more entertaining than her other classes because she is very passionate about this region of the world. There are no tests but there is a project and three essays for both midterm and the final where you have 3 and 7 days respectively. The essays are very difficult but she gives extra credit up to 7.5 percent. I recommend this class to people who can do the readings and attend classes regularly.
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology of South Asia,ANTHRO 116,N/A," I have taken three courses with Professor Smith now (Anthro 8, 116, and 119P) and I completely adore her. She is one of the most excellent and interesting professors in Anthro that won't blow your brain up with readings that, frankly, have no clout in the class except for the professor finding them ""interesting"". She is a real life archaeologist in South Asia and often uses her own work as an example for the class. My advice for students thinking about enrolling in any class Professor Smith offers is GO FOR IT!!! She is exciting, funny and gave me the rare will *trust me I usually do not have time to * to go to her office hours. Okay, well enough of oozing my love for her all over Bruinwalk---class breakdown Anthro 8: I took this bad boy a while ago, it is not hard to get an A in this class from what I can remember...just know the sites presented...and attend lecture Anthro 116/119P: Smith is so knowledgeable on these two topics. Once again, if you attend lecture and DO THE READINGS these should not be bad at all. In addition, make sure you do know details to add to written statements such as essays...they really help to boost the paper overall Good Luck!"
Monica L Smith,NA,Archaeology of South Asia,ANTHRO 116,N/A," South Asian archaeology is her area of specialty and it definitely shows through in this class.  Her lectures are full of interesting facts about ancient India.  Pay attention to everything, because most of the material for the tests come from her lectures, though you'll find a few questions that can only be found in the text.  Her tests are tough, but not impossible and consist of multiple choice, short answer, and essay questions that force you to really show your knowledge.  She's more than happy to help her students with any questions, even adjusting her office hours to work with various students schedules before the test. Overall she's a great speaker, enthusiastic about the class, and always willing to expand on ideas in class. Not an easy A, but you'll find the class interesting and fun!"
Allen W. Johnson,NA,Latin American Communities,ANTHRO 161,N/A,"Johnson is a nice guy.  His class is boring, but easy.  He tells you exactly what to know for the essays on the exams, and it is pretty obvious what multiple choice questions he is going to ask.  The reading was mediocre, but I think you can get buy without doing a lot of it."
Allen W. Johnson,NA,Evolution of Human Societies,ANTHRO 1530,N/A," This class is extremely dull and his voice will put you to sleep.  The case studies...oh my, they're long and ramble on and on.  The text (written by Johnson) is hard to comprehend and will also put you to sleep. He is really pick about the format of the essays on the midterms and finals.  The multiple choice is also tricky.  Be careful. Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this class.  He's probably a nice man but an ineffective professor."
Jennifer Rashidi,NA,Paleopathology,ANTHRO 126P,A,"I took this class summer 2022 for session c6. The first week, I thought I was going to have to drop the course because how information heavy it is initially. If you're not familiar with biology its a lot to digest in 6-weeks, I am familiar with a little but with my busy summer schedule I was spreading myself thin at times. To my surprise, the midterm was very easy as long as you used to textbook. Thankfully, the textbook itself isn't dense and cuts straight to the point for topics. I didn't take the final so I can't speak on that, she was VERY accommodating for my situation and I wasn't expecting that at all. The final research paper I got a ""C"" on only because I had written it on a topic that wasn't considered a paleopathological topic- which I wish she specified more in class what counts and didn't count because I didn't know until after my paper had been graded. Other than that, the class was interesting. I honestly would not take it again but I think she's offering workshops for fall since her summer courses were offered only online."
Jennifer Rashidi,NA,Paleopathology,ANTHRO 126P,N/A,Hello! I am selling the book for Paleopathology. text me at 8183196901.
Jennifer Rashidi,NA,Paleopathology,ANTHRO 126P,F,"I took this in Summer C 2021. I got a Pass but based on the grades I got I would've received an A-. Dr. Rashidi is amazing and this class is super interesting. However, it is a lot of work especially if you're not well versed in biology. Also she isn't the best at responding to emails, and often took a while to upload lectures. But her teaching style was very clear and you got all the information you need from lectures. There was a final research project that wasn't tough (I got 40/40), and the exams were open book open note (except for the practical portion which was in class with cameras on and closed note/book) so it wasn't difficult to do well. Highly recommend her and this class!"
Jennifer Rashidi,NA,Paleopathology,ANTHRO 126P,A,"If you don't mind lectures slides that haven't been updated since 2003, then this class is for you. Professor Rashidi doesn't allow electronics in her class so all notes must be taken pen / paper - what makes this class a little annoying is that the professor talks at about 500 words / minute. On the flip side, there isn't much that is covered in class for each topic so their is only so much that can be on the exam. This quarter she decided to post a study guide, and to her surprise it was the best tests grades she's ever had as a class... mmm. There is a research paper that one must write, it expands on a topic covered in class. To be honest, this class wasn't as difficult as she made it out to seem, her study guide states that one must commit to a solid of 8 hours of studying / week to do well in her class but much less is needed, maybe a solid 2 hours / week."
Jennifer Rashidi,NA,Paleopathology,ANTHRO 126P,A," I loved this class so much, and a year and a half later I still remember so much from it and it stands out as one of my favorites. Professor Rashidi is definitely a tough professor and this is definitely a college-level course. There is a ton of memorization involved and you really have to pay attention and be engaged with the lectures and review the slides. However, the content is so interesting and Professor Rashidi also helps make it interesting. I had no trouble coming up with a paper topic and I had so much fun writing it (I know that sounds so lame but honestly I usually hate writing papers but this one was so enjoyable).  tl;dr: it’s a difficult course and you have to put in the work and study and come to class, the material is so interesting and rewarding to study that it’s still been one of my favorite classes at UCLA."
Jennifer Rashidi,NA,Paleopathology,ANTHRO 126P,A-,"Getting an A on the first try is doable, but you have to put in the work!"
Jennifer Rashidi,NA,Paleopathology,ANTHRO 126P,A+," I think it’s a great class, and Dr. Rashidi is incredibly knowledgeable. She’s very engaging, but don’t expect her to handhold you throughout the course. The slides are not always clear, and she’s a fast talker. But if you supplement lecture notes with the book, you’ll be fine.  Electronics are not allowed in her class, which I think is great. She doesn’t  always come across as the most organized. At the end of the quarter we had to hand in a 8-10 page research paper- you have to come up with your own topic and it must be related to class. I definitely enjoyed her class, and would recommend her- unless you don’t like to put in the work."
Jennifer Rashidi,NA,Paleopathology,ANTHRO 126P,C+,"The first time I took this class I failed, and not because I didn't try but because there was just so much information that I could not remember it all. Her midterm is composed of multiple choice questions, definition fill-ins, and about 3-5 short essay questions and one big essay questions. The final is cumulative but it weighs mostly on the latter half of the course.  The material she teaches is wonderful and engaging. But it is the way she teaches that makes this course so hard. She uses powerpoints which are helpful for visuals, but what she says takes precedence over the powerpoints. Meaning, not all the information you need will be on those powerpoints so attending lecture is crucial for passing this class. Also, she is a very fast talker and goes through all the material quickly.  She does not bruin cast her lectures and she allows no recordings nor laptops in class and this makes it quite difficult to get down all the concepts and major factors when she speaks 1000 words a minute. She requires a book that is quite costly, but honestly, I never read it and it wasn't needed for testing, so don't spend your money.  You are required to know anatomical terminology and will be asked to conduct a research paper which is not hard if you chose a topic discussed in class. As a professor, she is very responsive, and she does try her best to give you pointers on how to succeed in her class. She also gives extra credit which is a bonus.  If you take this class, consider building up a study group within the class, take GOOD notes,  attend all lectures, and read the dumb article that she posts."
Jennifer Rashidi,NA,Evolution of Genus Homo,ANTHRO 126Q,F,"I took this class online due to the pandemic. The workload is fairly high and the material is pretty dense. Homeworks were usually a 2 page (Double space) write up of a subject using one or two peer reviewed articles. There was a 5-7 page research paper on a topic of your choosing that was actually pretty engaging. Midterm and final were short answer, short essay, and an essay. Open resources. Communication via email was poor. Grading was reasonable, not nit picky. Overall a fun class but necessarily an easy A."
Jennifer Rashidi,NA,Evolution of Genus Homo,ANTHRO 126Q,C+,"Rashidi is the worst professor ever. I would never ever recommend this class to someone. It is unfortunate because the material is super interesting. She goes through a lot of material very quickly and does not explain her slides very well. The class is paper only and she does not allow laptops for note taking, but honestly her lectures are not much supplement to the slides. She expects you to remember every little detail for her exams and she does not even give a study guide. She also is not very responsive to emails, I emailed her three times in the quarter and never got a response back. She seems to have a lot of going on in her personal life and even cancelled a week's worth of class, which meant that she went through the material really fast so it could be on the final still.  Her grading for the exams are not consistent and she was not clear about what exactly she was looking for. Some people were not docked down for only putting one word answers, while others were. She also assigns a lot of reading on top of the class lectures slides. It is like she expects people to be a paleopathologist. I would never take a class with her again."
Jennifer Rashidi,NA,Selected Topics in Biological Anthropology: Forensic Anthropology,ANTHRO 129,B,"Super chill professor, midterm and final are very straight-forward. Lots of memorization required involving anatomical locations, bones, and things of that matter. My TA was extremely helpful and discussion/labs are required but are only an hour every week. I did little to no reviewing prior to exams and did ok. If I did review, I honestly could've achieved an A."
Jennifer Rashidi,NA,Selected Topics in Biological Anthropology: Forensic Anthropology,ANTHRO 129,B+,"Even though going into this class there's a lot of memorization and a slightly heavy workload, if you find the course content interesting enough then you should be just fine. Personally I went into this class not knowing how much I'd enjoy it, but I was pleasantly surprised by how engaging it was. If you're a kinesthetic learner then the in-person discussion sections are perfect for you as you get to handle real human bones and other related course materials. Rashidi and my TA were EXTREMELY helpful and held office hours often. The only thing I'd say to watch out for is the difficult nature of the exams considering they're graded pretty meticulously, as well as the amount of studying you have to put in to actually do well enough on them, but even considering that I would definitely take this course again :)."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,D,This class is so hard i swear to god. If you do not like reading 2 books a week and having to memorize obscure sculptures from every single powerpoint from each lecture which is monday wednesday Friday every single week in addition to discussion this class is not for you. I found this out the hard way and I do not understand how reviews are this positive. I mean he is an all right guy but this is the only class at UCLA I have ever failed and this is a GE. Do not think this class will be easy!!!!!!! I cannot stress this enough.
John Papadopoulos,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,A,"Great lecturer, all around awesome professor. The tests do require a lot of memorizing but not intense information just being able to recognize pictures and a few facts on them.  I am selling all of the required reading books and also the course reader, if interested email me at Gisellemartinez@me.com"
John Papadopoulos,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,B-,"The only time I spent in this guy's office was when he disturbingly and wrongly accused me of cheating on his final exam.  True story, I hope it dissuades some students from this 'great' teacher .  Papadopoulos wrongly accused me of cheating on his final, because out of a class of 350 I was the most look-alike to the perpetrator,  who had allegedly posted a notice on facebook asking for someone's answers during the final.  So I recieved an 'IP' in the grade book and after two weeks, I finally emailed him and he invited me to his office.  He proceeded to look me straight in the eyes and tell me I've cheated on his exam, and I've been caught.  He pulled up printed pictures of my facebook profile and compared it to a blurry image of the cheater.  So he had searched the facebook profile pictures of all 350 students and singled out the one that looked most similar, and with a smirk on his face he showed me the comparison and forced me to log on to my facebook to confirm that it was my profile picture.  Later on I had the Dean of Students came to me and apologizing for his actions, but I never heard a word from this little guy.  So a fair warning to all, don't look like someone else or a bigoted, discriminatory little guy might mistake you for a cheater."

John Papadopoulos,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,A+,"The professor is extremely passionate about Greek culture and history. He has a storyteller voice and lectures a great time for explaining the main ideas. The number of books may seem a bit intimidating, but most are just excerpts of certain chapters. He is straightforward and really wants you to succeed. For our first midterm, he gave us the list of prompts for our short answer section and they were identical on the actual midterm. For the second midterm, he lists specific passages and readings you need to do, but if you have done them at least once, and know the date and author, they're not tricky! On the final, he gave us 5% free! (If you turn in a blank test, you still get 5%!) Many students may complain about the study images but its only about 50 you will need to go over per exam, hence not cumulative. Good luck! I definitely recommend it."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,B,"This class was honestly one of the hardest classes I've taken at UCLA. The professor is the head of the archaeology department, so all he cared about was pots. We had to memorize over 100 different pictures of random pots, their dates, who made them, what society they were made in, and what gods were depicted on them for the final. That was along with over 10 pages of vocab. This class is rote memorization and brought down my GPA."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A," This class sucked. You don't have to go to any of the lectures and you could get an A in the class as long as you do well on the midterms and finals and attend discussion. The lectures are all posted online but the midterms have basically NOTHING to do with what he talks about in lectures.  The midterms consists of memorizing ""study images,"" which is just a slide with a picture on it and a crap load of information like the dates, where it was found etc. There are 172 study images in total and he only picks 10 to be on the midterms and 15 to be on the final...and they're barely mentioned at all in lecture. The readings and the discussions were okay but this class is just pure, pointless, difficult memorization and if you're good at that and remembering excerpts from LONG readings then you're golden. I seriously regret taking this class, barely any people showed up to lecture and I would never recommend this class to anyone."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,B+,"Concise, knowledgeable, energetic and engaging, knows how to teach and convey class material well."

John Papadopoulos,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A," I learned so much about the Greeks in this class! I took it as a GE and feel that I was presented with information I would remember in the long run, not just info that would be quickly regurgitated on a test and forgotten. The tests can be hard if you don't study since you have to remember time and dates of Greek art but the reading was enjoyable and discussion sections were fun. There is an essay and who you get as a TA will really affect how you do in the class because some TAs were very harsh graders. But as a whole they are very fair and want their students to succeed. Participate in discussions! "

John Papadopoulos,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A," Dr. Papadopoulos has the greatest personality. He is extremely generous, kind, sweet, etc. All good adjectives would fit him. However, memorizing slides was pointless. Essays were given grades leniently. Two midterms and final will be okay as long as you spend about two enough days to memorize the slides. Also, you don't need to read books so don't waste money on them except probably Odyssey. Other books, you must read sparknotes in order to participate in discussion sessions and do well on the midterms and finals.  I hope more people can go to the lectures though. Dr. Papadopoulos is the nicest professor I've ever seen. "
John Papadopoulos,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A," First off, I'm a south campus premed major. Taking Classics 10 is great for two reasons, 1. There's cute north campus girls2. This entire class is basically rote memorization with less than 100 pages of reading per quarter! Read the These Were the Greeks book, write your essay on Plato's Apology(~50 pages of dialogue AT MOST) and you're golden. I pulled a B+ with studying the night before the midterms (69, 89) and then the final (91). It's doable but not entirely fun. "
John Papadopoulos,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A,"If you want to get screwed over on BOTH the first midterm AND first essay because of vague explanations and expectation then by all means take his class. I was expecting an easy GE when I enrolled. Boy was I wrong…a large portion of the exams is pure, pointless, memorization. Why does it matter if I don’t know when Plato died, for example? In the end, this class was more than I bargained for. I did not do badly in the course, but I worked a lot harder for this class than I expected to and to my dismay, the class was not curved. This review and the other three (mostly the two shorter reviews) below pretty much represent the opinions of the 300+ students in the class.Overall, I do not recommend taking this class, at least not with this teacher."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A,"I came in thinking it would be an easy GE, since basically all you had to do is memorize slides, it wasnt exactly as I expected. You may think memorizing the slides before the exams is a walk in the park, but the dates throw people off. You must know every single date, not even exaggerating. You must know every single detail on the slide, and must things that arent even on them (such as lecture powerpoint information/general knowledge of the images noted in the terms in the course reader). If you do all those, you're a great candidate for an A. Many chances for extra grades on tests as well, you like going above and beyond. The professor will basically outline the topics on the exam for you. Not very stressful at all. The final was simply a matter of whether you knew all the terms, slides, and readings."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A,"Papadopoulos is a great guy, but in my opinion, he made the class waay too hard and too much work for a GE. Being a south campus major, I'm not used to having to do essays in addition to midterms and finals. Also the slide memorization aspect was a complete waste of time. We had to memorize names of vessels and statues and DATES (which absolutely killed me). The final was ridiculously hard and he tested us on way too many greek terms. Needless to say, I do NOT have a background in ancient greek and bombed that part of the exam. "
John Papadopoulos,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A,Do not take this class unless you are willing to put in 40+ hours of work for two papers and two midterms plus a final all for a ge that is way more time consuming than it needs to be. Strongly recommend taking a different class.

John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,N/A,This is the worst GE I've ever taken. The lectures were boring and the exam was based on pure memorization.
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,B,"I feel terrible for saying this, but good lord is this class boring. I had 100% interest and investment when it began, and it so quickly faded just one week in. You will not do well if you're not great at memorization/slide ID's. I wish the professor would rework the class so the students would have a chance to engage with the material rather than blindly memorize and later forget it."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,A,"I took this class when they were offering a hybrid format so I never went to the real lectures and would skim through the ones posted online when they were relevant to the paper assignments. The lectures are pretty boring and long. This class has 3 assignments, each worth 30% and the remaining 10% comes from participation in discussion. I spoke a handful of times in discussion and answered using the Zoom chat function a couple of times and got a 95% for my participation grade. The lectures themselves really aren't that relevant to the papers so most people didn't show up for class. Overall, a great GPA booster but the content itself isn't that interesting."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,A,"Professor Papadopoulos is one of the sweetest professors ever. It is clear that he really cares about the material that he is teaching, as well as his students. Some of the archeology projects we learn about were actually conducted by or worked on by him, which is really cool! Lectures are not that interesting if I am going to be honest, but they also are not necessary to attend in order to do well in the class. I took this class winter quarter of 2022, so I took it online the entire quarter. Our grade consisted of discussion participation and three relatively easy papers, so it is quite easy to do well in the class as long as you put in a little bit of effort! If you are looking for an easy GE with a really cool professor, this class is definitely for you."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,N/A,This class was extremely boring!! The professor is a terrible lecturer and makes the material seem so uninteresting. The tests are based on memorization and I learnt absolutely nothing from this class.
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,N/A,This is the most boring class I've ever taken at UCLA. The professor's lectures are boring as well and the exams are completely based on your ability to memorize images. This class was one of the worst experiences I've had at UCLA.
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,A-,"Papadopoulos was honestly such a gem. He makes it obvious how passionate he is about the material and that makes it easy to become passionate about the material yourself. He lectures in class and it follows the textbook but you don't actually have to do any of the reading for the midterm or the final at all - it's just memorization and identification of different artworks and there's lots of extra credit! Most people got over 100% on the midterm. The readings are only really useful for the 2 papers and the class overall is pretty great, definitely recommend for a very lowkey, easy, interesting GE."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,A,"I took this class because I thought it would satisfy two GEs, but it does not (I now realize that is not a thing; however, you do get to choose which GE you want it to satisfy. The lectures are extremely boring and you do not need to go to class. So, take this class if you do not want to attend lecture. The midterm is just all memorization, which is alright but difficult to master and I feel like I did not learn anything. There are two papers worth 25% and then also a final that is similar to the midterm. The professor is very nice though, and has a soothing voice."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,A,"I would consider this an ""easy"" GE. I say easy because the class during my quarter was solely graded on three essays of about 1000 words, and there were no tests or homework. Attendance in discussion is required, but the essays aren't even dependent on the lectures; you are given sources to use instead. In fact, I stopped going to lectures after about the second week and never looked back. Professor Papadopoulos is pretty nice and accomodates his students well."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,A,No tests and no need to go to the lectures. We had 3 papers throughout the quarter that weren't even related to the lectures. Super easy GE if you don't mind writing about a boring topic.
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,A,If you need an easy A for a GE then definitely take this class. The only assignments are three 5 page papers that you have to write. Go to sections because of attendance but you can for sure skip the lectures because nothing that is taught there is what the papers are about.
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,A,This class is rly rly chill. Your grade is basically 3 writing assignments (based on a documentary or based on some readings) and participation in section. The lectures and the weekly readings have nothing to do with the writing assignments that actually go into your grade so you basically just have to focus on the writing assignments right before they're due and go to section. The writing assignments did take me a few hours each especially when the readings were dense but I didn't mind since there's only three the whole quarter
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,A+,"LITERALLY THE EASIEST CLASS EVER. structure: no homework, no attendance required for lectures, no exams3 essays: 750 words, based on documentaries, super easy, wrote all the day before and got A+ on all threereadings are assigned for HW but really not necessarylectures are SUPER boring but prof papa is so sweet and really passionate"
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,N/A,"SUPER EASY! Broken down into 3 essays 700-1200 words, each 30%, discussion was 10%. Lectures aren't mandatory. Lenient TAs, I recommend Rachel Wood, she is bubbly, sweet, helpful, and a fair grader."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,A+,The lectures and readings were both optional. This class was so easy. Even the essays were easy since you just had to write about your opinions on the artifacts. Didn’t mean to take it but I’m glad I did.
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,B+,"I found Professor Papadopoulos to be such an endearing professor. He recorded his lectures, uploaded all the slides and readings before the quarter started, and was very straight forward. You can tell he loves what he does. Although his lecturing can be a little dry, he is always willing to take questions and excited to share his personal photos of excavation sites that he has worked on. He is very knowledgeable and approachable. This course consisted of three essays and your participation in discussion. The papers were basically an outline of questions he provided. Each paper came attach to a research journal about an archaeological find. The environment of the course was low stress. If you need a class for units that doesn't require too much then I would recommend this one. If he keeps the no exams component of the course (just the 3 papers) then you don't even need to attend class because the essays aren't necessarily attached to the course."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,A,"I took this class because I thought it would satisfy two GEs, but it does not (I now realize that is not a thing; however, you do get to choose which GE you want it to satisfy.

The midterm is just all memorization, which is alright but difficult to master and I feel like I did not learn anything. There are two papers worth 25% and then also a final that is similar to the midterm. The professor is very nice though, and has a soothing voice."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,A+,"Really really easy class with a nice professor. Most people don't really care about the class, and he recognizes it (he joked before the midterm that he'd never seen the class this full before, LOL), but he doesn't intentionally try to make things tough for all of us because people don't really care, he just lectures to those who do care and are interested in what he has to say. Personally, I didn't care too much about this class, but I also had a lot of other tough classes this quarter and I couldn't bring myself to get up early to go to the class. I didn't show up to class at all after the midterm (besides on the days our papers were due), but really you don't miss out on much. In discussion, you get the sense that nobody really knows what's going on either, but it's not too tough to keep up and skim the readings right before the discussion. Honestly, a lot of the material is really interesting, but the way that Professor Papadopoulos presents it is slightly dull. The midterm is as simple as advertised, spend a solid four hours the night before the exam memorizing those slides, get yourself 100+ pretty easily. Both papers were interesting as well if you put a little effort into researching them. I think writing those papers really taught me a lot and I learned way from doing my own research on the topics than I did from the lectures that I attended. Highly recommend this GE if you're looking for something that's low effort (requires probably like 30 hours of your time all quarter long, if you don't go to lectures), and with generous grading (lots of extra credit on the exams)."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,F,"Professor Papadopoulos is a really nice person. You can notice he loves teaching these topics. But let me tell you, this class was boring. He would show slides and slides of pottery and would talk about every detail about them. Going to the lecture is optional because almost nothing that he says in class will be tested. After the midterm, the lectures were pretty empty, with only 40 -50 people showing. He grades two essays, a slides identification midterm and a similar final.The essays are graded by the TAs. You will have to MEMORIZE around 75 images and will have to identify some of them in a test. It is a light GE if your memory is quite good."

John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,A-,"As others have said, going to lecture is optional. I started feeling bad though after the midterm people started leaving and only like 30-50 people went. Prof. Papadopoulos was a little petty for students who came in and turned in essays and left. There were 2 essays throughout the quarter, each were 4 pages each & the midterm had the slide id’s. Since I took this in Winter 2020, our final became optional. I opted out because I was scared I’d do bad. If it weren’t a take-home final, it would have been 81 slide id’s and 11 sites/locations in Greece."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,A,"This class was great to take as a lightweight GE since it requires very little time and attention. There are two papers, one midterm, and one final. The topics of the two papers are quite easy and given well in advance. My TA was also super helpful in giving me feedback on my papers before the due date so that I was able to do well. Also, the required text was really useful for the papers because it contained a lot of the information the professor goes over (I'm selling a copy of the book for $10 - text me at 8182742372 if interested!). The midterm and final are the same format - the professor shows some slides with artifacts, paintings, or the like and asks for specific facts about them (time period, artist, etc). Both the midterm and final are quite easy if you spend a couple days before memorizing the slides he designates for the midterm and the final. Honestly, very doable! He also gives a lot of opportunities for extra credit during the midterm and final, which allowed most people to get above a 100%. All in all, I highly recommend this class. The lectures can get very boring and hard to sit through, but they are also not mandatory and aren't super helpful to go to. You can get by pretty well by reviewing the lecture slides he posts on CCLE."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,B,"I took this class because I thought it would be an easy A.  Honestly  just find an easier class.  I put so much effort into this class and it is an insane amount of work.  The lectures are really boring, no offense to professor Papadopoulos.  I stopped going to lecture after the midterm because there’s really no point in going to lecture.  In week 1 he gives you a PowerPoint of the exact slides you need to know for the midterm and final.  You have to memorize 80 slides for the midterm and then 80 slides for the final.  It was too much to memorize and just a bunch of useless facts.  Aside from that, there are two writing assignments and they have to be 1,000-1,500 words.  You’re grade really depends on your TA.  I know other people who got an A on their writing assignments despite writing it last minute and saying they were surprised to have gotten an A.  My TA was a harsh grader.  I’m not trying to throw shade at her but I got a B on both of my writing assignments which means there’s no way I could get an A in the class.  Those two assignments were so boring and time consuming.  I complained about this class all the time.  Overall, if you want a class where you don’t have to go to lecture or do any of the readings and you don’t care if you end up with a B instead of an A, then take this class.  It’s all based on memorization and whether or not your TA is a harsh grader.  Maybe you’ll get lucky though and have a TA who grades easy.  However, if you want an A and don’t want to spend hours trying to memorize a shitload of slides then take another class.  I guarantee there are easier ones."

My TA gave a lot of feedback after the first essay so I knew what she wanted for the next in terms of what to research in the textbook. The midterm and final is just memorizing a ton of slides with pictures and descriptions of these pictures. You can cram this in 2-3 days but it will be tiring. Or you can put in the work like a normal UCLA student and go to lecture to learn about all the greek artifacts. Both can get an A pretty easily i'd say!"

John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,B,"Okay, take this class if you’re good at memorization. You really don’t even have to go to ANY lecture. I feel bad for saying this cuz he’s so nice, but it’s true. The midterm consists of 80 slides that you have to memorize and so does the final.  To be fair he gives us ALL the slides in the beginning of the quarter so it’s completely 100% doable. But we’re all just lazy. Anyways. There’s two essays which mostly depend on what your TA thinks of them so just ask them for help and you’re solid on that part. I got a B because I didn’t study at all for the final and I got a D on the final but since I had an A on my midterm and essays, I got a B overall. You DONT have to do any of the readings. I didn’t. So, if you’re good at memorization and hate going to classes, take this."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,A+," This class requires a lot of busy work and memorization, but as long as you put some time into the class, it's not hard. It is way more work for a GE than I was expecting, so be prepared to spend quality time with the material-you have to memorize 80 slides for both the midterm and the final, but extra credit is offered on both so it is easy to get an A or above on both. This class is definitely TA dependent because the two 5-6 page papers are a big chunk of your grade (25% each), and some TAs were way harder graders than others. It is helpful to come into the class with the ability to write a good essay since it can break your grade if you do poorly on the essays. The upside of this class is that you don't have to go to lecture, because none of the lecture material is on the midterm or final and you don't have to incorporate lecture topics into the papers. I only went to lecture a couple times the whole quarter and still got an A+- just make sure you go to discussion since it's participation points (10%) and the TAs can give helpful insight into the midterm and final.  selling textbook for this class- text me (805) 400-8312"
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,B,"I do not recommend this class. I never leave reviews here but I felt like i needed to warn people not to take this class. I'm a second year and have taken many GE's but this is ridiculous for a GE. You have to memorize roughly 80 slides for each test (one midterm and the final), which isn't too bad. The professor tells you EXACTLY what the midterm and final format will be and they are fair tests. However, the midterm is only worth 20% & there are two writing assignments each worth 25%. So even though the tests are fair, the TA's make it nearly impossible to do well in this class. I don't want to speak for all TA's & you can scroll down to read the rest of the reviews and about other people with the same experience as me, but all I can say is my TA was WAY too harsh of a grader and getting 2 B's on the essays pretty much left me with no chance of getting an A in the class. If you're looking to take this for a GE, just don't. There are easier ones out there I promise."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,B-,"I didn't enjoy this class much, mostly because I had a harsh grader of a TA. The lectures are boring and so are the readings, but for the most part, both the midterm and final are all memorization.  There are two papers, both 5-6 pages which is a bit much for a GE, not to mention how boring it is to have to elaborate that much. Professor is a bit of a dry lecturer mostly because he refers to every single artifact as one of the most fascinating discoveries ever. He is funny and a bit of jokester, but still that doesn't compensate for how boring the class is. If you are okay with memorizing material, even for a boring topic, take this class."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,A+,"This class was really easy. I never did the readings and just improvised things to say during discussion for participation credit. You don't have to go to lecture. I earned an A+ from putting a decent amount of effort into the two essays assigned in the class. I got 95% on both essays. Try to write a lot and incorporate pictures. I got a 116% on the midterm: it was pretty simple since he had a lot of extra credit. You didn't have to go to lecture to get the extra credit, you just had to remember information from the study images. I got a 96% on the final. The final was annoying since he put stuff on there that wasn't on the study images, but it's still fine as long as you memorize the study images. You should be able to get the majority of the points. I took this class with three other classes (another GE, 30C ochem, LS 4). This class was very manageable with my other classes, mostly because I didn't go to lecture. Tldr: lecture is a waste of time, just memorize the study images, write a lot in your essays. A+"

John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,A,"Overall, I really enjoyed this course. It's very do-able as long as you memorize the slides, show up to discussion period and turn in papers on time. The midterm was not bad; however, the final was a little trickier. There are extra credit opportunities that allows you to get above 100% on both the midterm and final. The two papers are not bad at all. As long as you follow the prompt, have a complex thesis and incorporate some solid research you should be able to receive a decent grade. It is also very clear that Prof Papadopoulos knows a lot about what he is teaching. Highly recommend as a GE!"
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,A-,"This class was a pretty easy GE. I highly recommend it. Dr. Papadopoulos is a nice guy who really cares about the material. Also the textbook costed like 5 or 10 bucks. This class is broken down accordingly.Participation (10%)- Go to every discussion and talk. I went to every discussion and talked a good amount and a got a low A in this category. I thought we'd all get 100's if we participated, but we didn't. I'm not mad about my score, but just be aware you need to really talk to do well in this category.Midterm (15%)- Study the slides a few days before and memorize everything. Almost everyone I know got over a 100 on the midterm because of all the extra credit. Try to do well on this so it can be a cushion for your grade.Papers (25% each, 2 total)- Can be tricky. I highly recommend going to TA OH and asking questions and getting feedback on an outline and/or thesis. If you work with your TA and make good use of your resources to draft a falsifiable thesis you should be good. That being said I felt like getting a B on the papers was no issue, but getting an A was somewhat difficult.Final (25%) In my opinion a lot harder than the midterm. There was no extra credit and one slide was not even from the study images. Not bad, but try to get your grade high enough that you aren't relying on the final to bring it up.Also, winter 2017 he offered 1% extra credit if we went to a film screening of this archeology documentary. Although this was a one time thing (I think), know he may offer other extra credit.Also you don't have to go to lecture to do well, but it definitely helps you become more familiar with the material. You don't need to do the weekly readings either."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,A,"In total, there are two 4-5 page essays, 1 midterm and 1 final. The two essays might be tedious but won't be a problem if you do the assigned readings that are related to the prompts. Although Professor Papadopoulos gave out assigned readings for each week, I never did any of them except for the first few and was fine. The midterm and finals are purely based on memorization of the study image slides (roughly 70 to memorize for each exam); by going to all lectures for the first half of the quarter and memorizing the slides 2 days beforehand, I was able to get a 111/100 for the midterm (He gave out plenty of bonus questions for extra credit). For the second half of the quarter, I barely went to lectures and was still able to get an A for the course."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,N/A,"Professor Papadopoulos makes lectures optional and you don't even need to review the power points for the final or midterm. You do have to memorize slides, but there are no tricks and it's really easy to do well. You don't have to do the readings either. There are two essays, a midterm, and  a final. very easy A, would recommend!"
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,N/A,"This class was probably the most annoying class I have ever taken at UCLA. Memorizing 80 slides the night before the midterm AND final was extremely painful. And pulling all nighters writing those two papers was equally painful. However, given you put all that work in you are pretty much guaranteed an A (unless you're not a very good writer or your TA grades your papers harshly). Honestly I don't understand all the fuss about how much extra credit Papadopoulous gives. The papers combined were worth 50% of your grade - which is a lot. And for my TA's section the average on the papers was 85%. Also, I'm not sure why people say there is so much extra credit. There was a good amount on the midterm and I ended up with 103.5/100 on it, but it was only worth 15% of our grade. The final, however, had no extra credit and one of the slides was NOT in the study images. Also some of the questions he asked on his midterm and final were not provided in the study images. I ended up with a 90.4/100 on the final. My overall grade was an A, but I got a 94 and a 93 on the papers. I would take him if you're really good at writing papers and memorizing. If you don't mind the excruciating pain of memorizing useless slides and writing useless papers, then take his class for an A. Otherwise you might get screwed with an A- or B+ like some of my friends."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,N/A," Come on guys, Professor Papadopoulos is an AMAZING teacher! Yes I have to admit that we had to memorize 80+ study images (and details e.g. date, people involved, pictures depicted, etc) for each of the exam BUT if you have photographic memory or are willing to work hard for an A, this class is no big deal at all. I felt really bad for him cos he puts up everything online and only like 1/5 of the people turned up to class. Man i mean, the lazy ones missed out. Professor Papa (lets make things short) is very knowledgeable and has personal connections with Greece/the archaeology field so every little story he tells, is no pseudo. He can talk about one single pottery for 5 minutes, and it's not boring at all! You'll just feel like you're 3000 thousands back in time and reliving what you're seeing in his powerpoints.  He gives a lot of bonus points in his exams so it's really easy to get high scores. Only tricky thing is although he said you didn't have to study the lecture slides for the exams, you better do. Cos he does ask subtle questions from them and oh, the map section on the finals was tricky too, cos he won't tell you which places he'll test on, just ""the ones he's talked about"". So yea. But overall, HE'S GREAT AND I LOVED HIM AND THIS COURSE!"
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,N/A," NEVER attended lectures except for the 1st one and exam reviews. Got A- because my TA (who was a bitch btw) only gave me a B for one of my papers. Memorization of slides, piece of cake. He said that he'd put IDs on final but he decided not to for some reasons (I felt so relieved to hear that since I never went to lectures and knew nothing about the material) Easy class, recommended for GE"
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,N/A," I'm the type of person who NEVER misses class lectures and ALWAYS does the required readings. But I had so much difficulty motivating myself to go to these lectures. I went for the first six weeks and then just stopped all together and got an A+ in the class. Professor Papadopoulos is a sweet man and you can tell he is really in to the topic and cares about the students. It's really just slides though (that he puts online), basically an art history course...something I have never been interested in. If you are good at memorization this class will be a piece of cake. I bought the course reader but felt like it was a waste of money since I only used it for the essays. My TA was nice, very approachable, but it was obvious she couldn't stand that none of us did the readings (still got an A+ in participation and As on both the papers).  Overall, I do recommend the course, just make sure you go to discussions and give yourself a couple days in advance to memorize all the slides (there are a lot of extra credit opportunities too)."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,N/A," I never attended lecture except for the 1st one and midterm/final review. Just memorize EVERYTHING in study slides. ~75 slides for midterm and ~75 slides for final. Midterm will only test you on slides, and I've got 104/100 (lots of extra credits) and I didn't go to lecture at all! Final = slides + map + essay.  1.Slides no problem (but few questions aren't covered in study slides, no idea why the fuck did he include those) 2.Map, easy just memorize all the sites (11 of them) 3. Essay, 300- 500 words, questions given a week before final. Pretty easy.  I've got 91/100. I've messed up my essay I guess. The hardest part of the course is 2 essays (each 20%). It's 4-5 pages, and if you've got a TA like mine (a bitch called Chelsey), then you're unlikely to get a good grade. (I've got 88 & 85) If it isn't her, I would've got an A. "
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,N/A,"If you are looking for an easy GE course, do not take this class! There is a lot of information to remember, including memorizing over 80 slides for the midterm and final, and 2 essays. However, this class was extremely interesting for I am fascinated with Greek culture, and I have learned a lot for Prof Pap. is intelligent, humorous, and eloquent. The only bummer was that I had a horrible TA who never replied to my emails and discussions were a waste of time (although he was pretty helpful in preparing for the midterm and the final). If you are up for the challenge, I'd recommend taking this class, but if you're looking for a snooze class, don't take it."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,N/A,"If you study hard and do the essays, there should be no reason for why you can't get an A in this class. I got an A+, meaning I could have slacked off a bit more.  Number 1 rule: DO NOT BUY THE COURSEREADER! For over 100 bucks it is not worth it. I did not buy it, and I got an A+... You basically do not need to read any of the readings, except maybe for the two essay you have to do.  I highly recommend that although you do not buy the coursereader, that you somehow get access to it by either finding a friend or checking it our from the library reserve. That al said, the essays were the biggest pain in the world to do. They require research, which is annoying for me.  I did them both in one day (meanding ALL DAY), and ended up staying up till 4 am each time. Studying for midterm basically requires you to memorize 60 study images, and same goes with the final.  For me it wasn't hard, since I am good at memorizing; however, it does still take a while. Personally, I say I spent at least 6 hours the night before to memorize. The final also had a map of Greece to study for (simple memorization), and an essay (He gives you the prompt beforehand, so you need to research a bit). That all said, the reason it is sooooooo easy to get an A is because he offers a crazy amount of extra credit.  I got 120% on midterm, and that wasn't even a perfect score. I think perfect was like 130%. On the final I got 101%, which meant I missed more than the midterm but still got a ridiculously high grade. On my essays I got 81% on the first, and for some random reason I got 95& on the second (I think I actually worked harder on the first but whatever). Basically do well on the midterm and final so you can have a buffer against an low essay scores. I guess don't overstudy and get an A+ like I did, although this is the first A+ I've ever gotten and is kind of cool. Anyway, take this class if you want an ""easy"" A (IF YOU STUDY)!  Oh and stuff BESIDES the grading...this class is fairly boring, with several people sleeping during it. This is NOT to mean that Papadopoulos is boring, because he does his best to make the material interesting. He says some jokes from time to time, and is extremely enthusiastic about the subject matter and is clear that he has a passion for it (which I can respect). I surprisingly ended up gaining some interest in the ""art and archaeology of ancient Greece,"" so I am glad I took the class. The initial great boredom and the dumb research essays made me second guess my decision at times though, but that is because I hate research to a passion. If you don't, then for sure take this class."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,N/A,"Professor Papadopoulos is a fantastic professor, and delivers absolutely flawless lectures.  Even if you know nothing about archaeology, he presents the material in such an organized and straightforward fashion that what he says on the first day of class is absolutely true: ""I want everyone to get an A, and if you don't get an A, it's your own fault.""  He is almost overly generous with the extra credit on his exam, and so long as you put a decent amount of effort into the assignments and exams, you should be fine.  There are 75 slides images for both the midterm and the final, which is definitely a lot of material (dates, names, etc) to memorize, so start studying those probably at least 4-5 days in advance, and then it won't seem as daunting.  The only real surprise is that for the 2 essays (4-5 pages), you will probably have to do a bit of outside research, which is somewhat unconventional for a lower-division GE class, but again, as long as you put a decent amount of effort into it (and you can write a grammatically sound essay), it should be no problem to do well.  Definitely a great professor, and an absolute must if you are at all interested in Greek art or archaeology! "
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,N/A,"Great professor, tried to make lectures engaging and interesting. He also has the greatest accent. This class is perfect for a south campus major-- all-in-all it is the most relaxing class i've had at ucla. The readings aren't necessary (only the ones needed for writing the papers) and the papers were easy to write (possible to write them the night before, but starting earlier is obviously better). This class requires little effort to get an A+ in considering all the extra credit given on the midterm and final. Highly recommended!"
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,N/A," I took this class with Chem 14C and Math 3C, two really really hard science classes. This class was a nice class to have because it required little effort. His lectures are pretty good, but I stopped going after a while cause I didn't have the time. He posts lecture slides online. Discussion is mandatory (1hr 15 min long) and its worth 10% of your grade (participation, stupid quizzes). 40% of your grade is comprised of two papers (4-5 pages; 1.5 spaced). The first paper was pretty easy but the second was a little harder. DO NOT WAIT THE DAY BEFORE FOR YOUR PAPER. The Classics TAs are notoriously harsh graders (avoid Claire Collins and Emily Rush as they are VERY HARSH GRADERS). MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE GOOD TOPIC SENTENCES OR THEY WILL TAKE ENORMOUS POINTS OFF OF YOUR GRADE. MAKE SURE TO REVIEW YOUR ESSAY WITH YOUR TA. There was a midterm that consisted of you memorizing 75 slides (just little tidbits of info and matching up with picture). I would say it requires 2 nights of 4-5 hours of cramming. There is also the oppurtunity to earn extra credit on the midterm. People like to exaggerate how much extra credit he gives you..HE DOES NOT GIVE YOU SOOOO MUCH EXTRA CREDIT, BUT DOES OFFER A LITTLE. YOU WILL HAVE TO EARN YOUR EXTRA CREDIT. The Final consisted of an essay (he gives you the prompt 2 weeks before hand), slides (a little bit harder questions this time), and a map identification portion. You will need the coursereader for the essays, BUT OTHER THAN THAT DO NOT READ THE COURSEREADER AT ALL; ITS IS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY. My final grade: A+ It was a pretty easy GE, requiring not much work, only a moderate amount of memorization. Compared to ethnomusicology 50A AND polisci 40 (2 easy ass GEs) it was a little bit harder. The Professor is really nice and if you are on the waitlist, YOU ARE GURANTEED IN THE CLASS: The MAXIMUM time investment needed to get an A:Midterm prep (2 days of 4-5 hrs) = 8-10 hrsTime For both essays = 15 hrs Final prep (13) 40 hours needed to 100% gurantee you get an A (its probably a little less if your smarter, or a little less if you want to not have a 100% gurantee of getting an A)or more hours if you're a dumbass and you decide to read the coursereader for some odd reason A good, stupid, easy GE that requires very little effort. I'm happy and so will you be :D"
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,N/A,"The class is called ""Greek Art and Archaeology"" on all the official documents, but this is actually wrong. The real course title is ""Automatic Points."" Papadopoulos hands out so much extra credit that by the end of the quarter you feel like the night of Halloween when you've eaten way too much candy. If you are capable of rote memorization and you put effort into the essays, you don't even need to pay attention to class, although Papadopoulos is an excellent lecturer so you may as well get your money's worth. It is very, very easy to get an A+ with minimal effort."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,N/A,"I'm a science major and I took it to satisfy a GE. This class was heaven compared to my science classes. I only went to lecture once a week. I would start memorizing the slides two days before each midterm, and would read some of the book and coursereader starting a couple nights before. Same goes with the final. The essays are straightforward. I got an A+ in the class with little to average effort put in, so def take it if you want an easy GE."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,N/A," As an engineer, I thought this class was going to be a little hard, but Professor Papadopoulos was an AMAZING professor! His lectures might have been boring every once in a while, but he always tried to make them interesting so that his students would actually go to lecture. Several students missed out on his AMAZING lectures. I especially remember one of his statements about the essay on the final exam: Good students can write about 2 pages of elegant arguments, but other students just write 15 pages of worthless crap (and he really used the word ""crap"" in that sentence)! Papadopoulos is VERY nice AND generous in terms of grading. He is aware that students tend to come in late for class (sleeping in, losing track of time, etc.), so he ALWAYS starts class five minutes after the scheduled starting time (although I would have rather ended five minutes earlier than start five minutes later). Also, on his exams, he always reassures pressured students (like me at the time) that ""there are plenty of opportunities for extra marks."" You'll probably not find another professor who will give as much extra credit as Mr. Papadopoulos himself. The two essays, however, took up A LOT of time: First, you had to choose one of two topics Professor Papadopoulos gives you. Then, you had to form an outline. Next, you had to gather all resources necessary and choose your concrete details; Professor Papadopoulos wants you to actually go to Powell Library and check out some reserved readings, but I never did, and I still got decent scores on the essays. Finally, you had to polish your essay with numerous commentary as well as transition sentences. It was a pain in the butt, but it's really important to do the essays because each essay was actually worth more than the midterm! The midterm was a slide-ID exam. I had never taken such an exam before, but I did extremely well because: 1. Papadopoulos asked REALLY easy questions like ""Where was so-and-so found?"" and ""When was this made?"" 2. Papadopoulos, in addition to the 15 slides for regular credit, added 2 more slides that were solely for extra marks, and those 2 slides were really easy. 3. The TAs reminded us that if we catastrophically screwed up the midterm, but made significant improvements on the final, Papadopoulos will bump up your grade. The final had 3 parts: a slide ID portion, a map portion, and an essay. The final's Slide ID portion was a little harder because Papadopoulos expected you to do the readings from his pretty expensive course reader; to be honest, I think you can get away with not doing the readings at all and still get an A, although you'll need the readings to write your essays. In the map portion, they give you 11 locations, and you had to identify what city each location is in. Finally, on the last day of lecture, Papadopoulos will actually GIVE you the two essay topics that will be on the final exam so that you can prepare for it (but you can't write it in your blue book because before each exam, he collects all the blue books and redistributes it out to prevent students from scribbling notes on their blue books before the exams). All in all, it was easy to get an A in his class. Over half of the class got A's and A+'s! I didn't spend too much time on this class, and I still ended up with an A. So if you are a Classics major, TAKING PAPADOPOULOS IS A MUST! If you don't take him, you'll be kicking yourself in the butt for the rest of your life."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece,CLASSIC 51A,N/A,"He is incredibly nice and passionate, and knows his material.  I was always amazed by how many dates he could remember.  The material was kind of dry if you ask me, but the class was easy.  Professor Papadopolous wants everyone to get As.  His exams were very straightforward and you get plenty of hints before hand.  The only reason I got an A- was because TAs grade the two papers (very straightforward also) and I got B+s on them."
John Papadopoulos,NA,Minoan Art and Archaeology,CLASSIC M153A,A,"He was chill, honestly stopped showing up after third week and was fine. There are 3 essays and thats the whole grade. On them make sure to hit every single detail, do not leave anything out. Other then that ur good to go gl"
John Papadopoulos,NA,Minoan Art and Archaeology,CLASSIC M153A,N/A," Course - Minoan Art and Archaeology Professor Papadapoulos was one of the best professors I've ever had at UCLA. I went into the course with a very mild interest in Minoan culture and left feeling like I'd learned more in 10 weeks than I had in any class before. His lectures are fun, engaging, and he's truly a nice guy. He cares very deeply that his students do well and always answers emails within a couple of hours if contacted before evening. The textbook probably wasn't necessary, but I still enjoyed the reading (especially because it really prepared me for lecture, as he divulges a lot of information really quickly and I wrote like a madwoman for an 1 hr and 15 min straight). He includes plenty of opportunity for extra credit in the midterm and final, which were only slide identification. Spend a lot of time on your research paper (I've heard he can be a tough grader on this one), allow yourself a couple of days to memorize the necessary slides, and there's no reason you shouldn't do well. I got 99%s on every assignment and it was probably my easiest class this quarter. "
John Papadopoulos,NA,Classical Archaeology: Greco-Roman Painting,CLASSIC M153K,N/A,Professor Papadopoulos is probably the best lecturer of any professor I have had at UCLA. He is very organized and is extremely fair with his grading. The midterm was slide IDs and a short essay. PS: during the slides he gives hints to what it is. If you go to lecture you are set for the midterm and final.
Wendy L Fonarow,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"this is NOT the class to take if you're taking it for a GE. There is way too much reading to do, and the course reader is really expensive also. Her levtures are incredibly boring. And her tests are hard. They are all short answers but it is hard, and she does not do any kind of reviews for them. I would not take this class purely for GE"
Wendy L Fonarow,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"I really enjoyed this class. Fonarow is a great lecturer, she is dynamic and brings up interesting points. There are A LOT of readings, but she does a thorough job of explaining everything."
Wendy L Fonarow,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"From a jaded third year who is sick of too much reading and of lower division classes in general, do not take this class.  The professor assigns an insane amount of thick, complicated, scientific reading, of which you are to make sense of and recite back verbatim for your midterm.  The TAs straight out said to us, ""You don't need to know the rituals of every tribe and those details, just know the broad abstract concept."" Unfortunately, my friends, that is BS.  Write down everything, read everything, remember everything, or perish.  Like I did.  If you're a Comm major and don't particularly like Antropology, I swear, do not take this class.  There are other less painful ways to fulfill your prep requirements."
Wendy L Fonarow,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"Although some of the concepts discussed are intriguing (as a linguist and an anthropologist, I would know), Fonarow teaches the class in a condescending style, throwing out complex terminology and saying, ""but you didn't need to know that"", and is also very authoritarian: after she spent most of a lecture talking about her ""analysis of audience spacing"" at her indie rock concerts and the students all got up and left a little early, the whole class gets this email threatening to cut short exam times.  I think she has an inferiority complex, and I would certainly not recommend taking her class--at least, certainly not anthro 33.  And don't get me started on the group project."
Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A,"I loved this class!  The lectures were engaging and I genuinely enjoyed learning the material.  The discussion sections were fairly easy with short, simple assignments.  The material was clearly presented in each lecture.  The most difficult part was memorizing vocabulary and being familiar with the evolutionary timeline.  However, after studying, I felt that the midterm and final were both very easy and straightforward.  You'll do fine if you put in a decent amount of effort.  It was not too time-consuming at all and there was little to no ""busy work"" or assignments unrelated to the lecture material.  It felt at times like an easier version of LS1, more so in the first half of the quarter."

Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A+,"I really enjoyed this class. I was scared because the bruin walk reviews were bad but i signed up anyways and I'm so glad I did! Prof Barret is actually a really engaging lecturer, and he bruin casts everything so only about 50 people would be in class. The tests were not difficult (just a midterm and a final), and were really reasonable. The homework was also easy, you could just do it over and over on the website until you got it right, and the hw for discussion only took like 10 minutes also. I really really liked this class and I'm sad it has such bad reviews!"
Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"The test are hell bc they are short answer and you literally have to memorize every word and definition to have a fair shot. Lecture are kind of bland, my TA was no help at all and I'm horrible at memorization so I had a difficult time. I mean I guess a word bank would come in handy but we didn't get one. The class itself is pretty interesting"
Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A," Tests are all short answers. Questions are written in a way that makes you think that a general answer explaining the  concept would be enough. Wrong, Wrong, Wrong. You've got to remember the specific vocabs used in the class (even for trivial stuff). Midterm was pretty time pressured.  Homework questions can be vague and weird at times.  Would not recommend as an easy GE. Take this class at your own risk"

Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"i took anthro7 with silk in 09w, and we had this guy as a guest lecturer one time when professor silk was gone at a conference. My adivce: take anthropology 7 with silk. She at least has a good enough grasp on the material to present it in a coherent fashion. This dude sounded like he was constantly struggling to think of the words in his next sentence - he would pause every few seconds to think of what to say next, and it just made him really painful to listen to. I usually go to silk's lectures, but if i had this guy i'm sure i would NEVER go to lecture, cause he sucks at lecturing. To be fair, he probably had to cover for her on short notice, and it wasn't even his own powerpoint that he was presenting, but  like i said, its just painful listening to him talk. Professor silk doesn't add many brilliant insights to the material either (she mostly just goes over the improtant points in the reading) but her lectures flow, and you feel like you understand the material better after hearing her talk about it. My opinion is just based on one lecture, so it is kind of biased, but i'd definitely take the class with Silk if i had a choice. "
Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"If you need to take Anthro 7, take it with Professor Joan Silk who co-wrote the book instead of Professor Barrett.  I have never fallen asleep in a class in my entire academic career, but I came very close to snoozing during Barrett's lectures because they were filled with ""ums"" and were extremely boring.  The only time the class had more than 1/4 of sudents in attendence was on the first and last day of lecture.  My TA made discussion complicated and useless.  There is weekly homework, a midterm, and a final, but Barrett does make a curve.  The exams are difficult and require hand-written answers in paragraph form. Since there is so much material to cover and there are no guidelines, knowing what to study is almost impossible.  I regret having taken this class, but if you do decide to take it, make sure to go to all lectures and really pay attention... if you can stay awake."
Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"If you read all the reviews here, I believe you get the overall sense that Dr. Barrett is not the greatest of teachers. That being said, I believe that he teaches the class well, and everything you need to know is in the lecture. Of course, he makes the test, so you only need to know that. Regardless, I liked the class, and he makes fun of Bush, which is good. If you get bored, use the wireless in Haines for the Internet."
Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Barrett is a moderately boring lecturer. After a while, I stopped going. How to do well in this class (1-4) 1 being high priority. 1. Go to section (covers all the hard concepts and makes things understandable). 2. Study his lecture notes he puts online (will help u answer 75% of his tests). 3. Read the book (the rest of the 25% of test questions are from book stuff not covered in lecture). 4. Go to lecture. I only did 1 and 2, and hopefully I got a B+/A-/A in the class. Actually, if you read the book in its entirety, it would probably cover all his lecture material. But this class takes you through the WHOLE book...so its a good amount of reading. So yeah, its an average class, not too hard, but not very interesting either. If you need it for a major requirement(Psych, etc) its not too bad, but if you just need some random GE, I'm sure there are more interesting ones out there to take."
Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Professor Barrett crams too much information into one lecture and is not really clear on the material that wil be on the test. He does know his stuff, and can explain it very well, theres just A LOT of information. The TAs help a lot but a great deal of outside work (basically reading) is required. He is a good teacher, but it IS a difficult class."
Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"this class was seriously one of the harder classes, but that's probably because i didnt open the book till the day before the midterm and then again the day before the test. i got an A but that's cause i rock. no seriously though it was REALLY hard and i drove myself nuts studying ALL the material the night before.  I have to be honest and say I went to lecture about 4 times all quarter, and I never read the lecture slides (which you can print out for free in the humanities computer labs.. ehh too much walking.)... the midterm and final were ALL essay, and i think i've acquired carpal tunnel syndrome, thanks a lot Barrett! but he's a cool guy to talk to outside of class"
Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"The material for this class was very interesting, I actually enjoyed reading the book.  HOWEVER Prof. Barretr totally killed it.  His lectures were so dull, all he did was repeat EXACTLY what we read the night before, only he didn't mention a lot of it and made it about 5 times more boring.  I never once was able to stay awake for an entire lecture, and after a while I just stopped going.  It was pointless.  All I had to do was read the book and go to section and I still got a B+.  The class had 400 people, and when I went to lecture the last day, there was probably only about 70 people there.  Take Anthro 7, but not with Barrett."
Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A," I was looking forward to this course. Flipping through the textbook before the class began, I was eager to learn all the material. However, the lectures proved little more than summarizing the previous lecture and copying-and-pasting images, charts, and passages from the textbook onto the powerpoint slide. By reading most of the textbook, staying half-awake in discussions, and never attending lectures, I pulled off a B+. If I had finished reading the second half of the textbook, I would have easily obtained an A. The class grade is 10% discussion, 40% midterm, and 50% final. The midterm and final is free response and takes forever. The answers on his answer key for the first midterm were very specific - he always insisted that we need not write more than a few sentences to answer each question, but most students wrote as much as possible, hoping to get a few points for the specific answer he was looking for. I was very disappointed with this class. Professor Joan Silk co-wrote the textbook, and I believe that in taking her class you would gain valuable insight on the concepts presented in the book, unlike in Prof. Barrett's class."
Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"don't ask me how, but i got a fail on the midterm and came up on a B in the class! i agree, barrett can definitely use improvement on the way he presents the material. i don't think i stayed awake even for one lecture, which is sad because evolution actually makes an interesting topic when you think about it. but overall, he's a nice guy and very approachable. just go to discussions and study the concepts and you'll be fine."
Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"I was actually enthusiastic about Anthro 7, but then my enthusiasm diminished shortly after I started attending lectures.  Barrett was great at paraphrasing the book, but that's about all he did.  Chapter by chapter, everything was repeated, and it was pretty sad because halfway through the class, people would always get up and leave.  The rest slumped down in their chairs and dozed off.  I feel kind of bad, but Barrett really needs to work on his presentation skills.  He lacks the speech skills needed to keep students focused.  If you decide to take the class, take it with SILK if possible--she co-wrote the text, so that may be a definite advantage.  Barrett may be a great guy, but his presentation strategies desperately need improvement."
Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Prof. Barrett is a great guy...he has great slides, yeah the problem is that he class seems never ending...it is really hard to try to stay awake in that class considering that you really don't need to take notes because the slides say it all. Read the book, and you will understand the concepts. I recommend this class. The tests are hard but they are not easy either...make sure you understand the concepts and you will do fine. Prepare yourself for a LONG final. That is something that I will never forget!"
Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,Dr. Barrett is a good lecturer. He has good slides and fair tests. I'd recommend taking his class.
Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Obviously I went on Prof review and was very excited to get such an supposedly outstanding teacher.  However, I forgot to remember that what an anthro major sees as a great teacher is for me someone who is boring and not effective at all.  The lectures were pure regurgitation of the book; he would just read off the words from the slides!!!  That was unforgivable.  I and many others didn't go to class b/c what was the freaking point?!?!  Studying for tests and actually learning something from class, would have been waaaaaaay easier if Barrett would just focus on the themes and concepts of the book instead of concentrating on what he was going to say in his next sentence. Since the final and midterm is about manipulating the concepts, Barrett should have focused more on that instead of going through his rote motions. It's obvious the guy is knowledgeable but he was so dead on stage and so static with the subject that I couldn't get into it.  Being an English major, I need metaphors and flash, maybe even some wit to keep me interested.  The subject itself was cool but Barrett was not. Warning: don't take him unless it's for your major.  Also, anthro/psych majors have no sense of humor at all...yeah and also for T.A.s. John talks too fast, blonde dude talks too slow and Lisa talks too loud. However, they were all great and knowlegable-- just different communicating styles."
Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Evolution and Biology of Human Behavior,ANTHRO 124,A,"I took another class with Barret and took this one because I liked him. He is very straightforward and his tests are multiple multiple choice, and have no tricks. this class was just a midterm and a final, and the reading pretty closely mimicked what happened in class. Definitely liked this class, but it was a pretty close review of anthro 1/7"
Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Evolution and Biology of Human Behavior,ANTHRO 124,B,"Professor Barrett is a great professor and is very knowledgeable on the topic of Evolutionary Psychology. I really liked him and thought that he was very engaging and made the content very interesting and relatable to our own lives. Despite liking him as a person, I disliked the class due to the syllabus. The midterm was worth 45% of your grade and the final was 55%. Therefore, there were no written assignments, no extra credit, nothing. Usually, in classes that I take where the grade is solely based on exams, I do pretty well in (A), but the way that Prof. Barrett asks his questions is very tricky and requires a lot of practice in order to master taking exams in this format. All of his questions offer option choices A, B, C, and then D would be answer choices A and B, and E would be answer choices B and C. FOR EVERY SINGLE QUESTION. It gets very confusing and it is easy to second guess yourself and you feel like your being tested on a mind game rather than content. He did curve the midterm which was nice and then ended up curving the class overall, I should have had a C+ but went to a B (which I'm extremely grateful for), but I feel like the content was way too simple and I had mastered it very well. Therefore, I felt like I deserved at least an A-. Additionally, in the beginning of the quarter he stated that he curves to the majority of the students get B's, so if you want an A, beware of this. Good luck!"

Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Evolution and Biology of Human Behavior,ANTHRO 124,N/A," For 124B, Evolutionary Psychology: great lecturer, posted his slides and was very organized. He does pause occasionally, but it's because he's trying to best phrase something. It didn't interfere with lecture, but after two years I assume he's gotten better with experience. He also had podcast, so I got to end the day early and learn at my own pace. His study guides are really just a list of concepts he;s covered, and his tests are applying them to problems- not once did he straight ask a definition. But I felt like that made my A's more legit :) The readings are easy, interesting and not too much. At most we read 2 chapters of a small book that at most amounted to 50 pages. For the people that said he's attractive.. he's very charismatic, very approachable, but only good looking when he's on stage. I might have been disappointed because he was a loooot shorter than I thought he'd be :( All in all though, I really felt like I learned something valuable. I have used the information in discussions, which really excited me. I think that's the best thing you can ask of a class! :D"
Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Evolution and Biology of Human Behavior,ANTHRO 124,N/A,"I thoroughly enjoyed this class with Clark. It is true that he made possibly dry subjects more interesting because of his passion for the subject and the relevance to the class. I'll admit that I also hoped for an A but I did not read all the material and ended up with a B. He's a great anthropology professor, however in regards to the lower division GE's that are geared toward non-anthropologists, you guys might not appreciate him to the fullest also because you do not like the subject in the first place. I also love Clark because he is way cute ;-) hehe"
Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Evolution and Biology of Human Behavior,ANTHRO 124,N/A,"As an anthro major I am really glad I took this course. The material is fascinating and I am incoporating the material into almost all of my other courses.  Prof. Barrett does a great job of streamlining the information for his lectures.  The downside is his tests are a little on the tough side.  I got my first B from him, the only one I have received at UCLA.  Although I wanted my A, I just couldn't do it.  Even so, I enjoyed it immensely and would reccomend it highly."
Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Evolution and Biology of Human Behavior,ANTHRO 124,N/A,"The subject matter for anthro 124 is interesting to begin with, so it's kinda hard not to like the class, but Dr. Barrett is such a good professor that he could have made the most boring course in the world my favorite one.  He's fun to listen to, extremely intelligent and knowledgable, and organizes his ideas in a logical and INTERESTING way.  His tests are a little on the challenging side, but they are very well made and are a really fair assessment of your knowledge.  Do the readings, listen in lecture, and ask questions when you have them, and you'll do fine.  The readings he picked were generally very interesting, although a few were a little dry; don't let that turn you away though.  Overall, this was one of my favorite courses at UCLA, and I have Dr. Barrett to thank for that.  All you lucky first years who get to take him for anthro 7, you're in for a treat!  And the girls seem to think he's cute too, so ladies, don't miss out!"
Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Evolution and Biology of Human Behavior,ANTHRO 124,N/A,"Professor Barrett is a very good instructor and the subject material was interesting. The exams were fair and his lecture style was very organized and concise. However, I found his disarmingly good looks to be quite a distraction. Here's looking at you, Harold ;)"
Harold Clark Barrett,NA,Evolution and Biology of Human Behavior,ANTHRO 124,N/A,"Professor Barrett is one of the best teachers I've had at UCLA.  He is passionate about the material and you can tell he wants you to learn as much as you can. His lectures are concise, organized, and tie in very nicely with the readings. I loved the way he structured the readings, combining readings on theoretical concepts with interesting and enlightening ethnographies.  I highly recommend him."
Sharon Bays,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"She is a good professor. People say she yells a lot, but she is only emphasizing important points of her lecture, and you better right it down because it will get you points on the test. Overall, she is an effective teacher and you will learn a lot. However, the discussion sections are pretty useless (15% of grade) and the TAs make it harder than its supposed to be. Also, be prepared to hear her feminist viewpoint all throughout the quarter."
Sharon Bays,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"  Although I have not gotten a grade yet, I thought Bays was a pretty good professor. The class was very interesting and so were the readings. However I did not find section that usefull, maybe because of my particular T.A. The exams were not hard at all and can be aced from a study guide given a week or so ahead of time. I would recommend the course!"
Sharon Bays,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"I think Bays' lectures were rather unorganized. She does not include any powerpoint or graphics, she just sits there and lectures. I also had trouble following her train of thought, it seemed like some of her sentences would just start out of the blue like ""And the fourth thing is..."" The reading and textbook are pretty interesting, and I actually got a lot out of the class because of my TA and our discussions. Oh, and the midterm and final are not cumulative and they are total breeze."
Sharon Bays,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A," I took Women Studies 10 with Bays and received an easy A+ in this class. Her lectures are very organized and she repeats herself a lot. Make sure you take notes because those are the ones you are going to study for the exams. She doesn't post anything online so go to class and try to stay awake. It will really help you, I almost didn't study at all at home because I remembered everything she said during class. The one thing you have to do is read some pretty tedious articles (some are interesting). You don't really have to read all that she assigns but only the most important ones, she says which ones these are or you will find out the week before the tests. She gives out a study guide and if you know the questions on the study guide/review, you will know the entire test. :)  Caution: she can be very moody and hates when people are late and when she discovers people haven't done their readings, it actually reached a point where I dreaded going to class in fear of her scolling us/me. If I was late, I didn't go to class at all. She wants the students to participate even if it's a class of about 250 students and gets mad if people don't answer her questions, also when people do answer her questions, she never hears what they say so they have to yell it over and over again. In my opinion, she should really leave the participation to the discussion sessions with the TAs."
Sharon Bays,NA,Introduction to Gender Studies,GENDER 10,N/A," Professor Bays is a great professor. I took her Asian American Studies 187C course (which is not listed below). At first she did seem a bit intimidating but she is an extremely sweet person who truly cares about her students. Throughout the course and lectures it was clear how passionate she was about the material she taught. Every discussion was very interactive and productive. She was always clear on what she wanted from her students and the high expectations she held. She always gave positive and encouraging feedback on writing assignments. But also gave constructive criticism when necessary. When I took her course she was recovering from a back injury. There were times when she was not available for office hours, but she always made an effort to make up for it. She was always available to discuss any coursework and more than willing to help during office hours.  After finishing her course I continued to stay in contact with her. She was more than willing to write me a letter of recommendation. Most Professors write a letter of recommendation and leave it as that. However, Professor Bays assisted me every step of the way in my application for graduate school. She also helped edit my personal statement. She's done more for me than what I could have ever asked for. To me that is what a great professor does and all it took was taking the time to go to her office hours to get to know her a little more. The support and help that she has done for me, both in undergrad and after, truly speaks to me what a true genuine professor she is. It is definitely difficult to find a professor like her at UCLA.   "
Sharon Bays,NA,Introduction to Gender Studies,GENDER 10,N/A, BEST CLASS EVER! Professor Bays is so FUNNY! I honestly just enjoyed coming to this class for a good laugh! She's so passionate about what she talks about which is amazing.  EASY GE!!!

Sharon Bays,NA,Introduction to Gender Studies,GENDER 10,N/A,"Professor Bays is an amazing professor! Her class is really interesting and she is a very understanding person. Her tests are easy because she gives you a study guide beforehand, which she goes over in detail before the midterm and final. you will learn so much and leave with an A or an A+! definitely take her"
Sharon Bays,NA,Internship in Women's Studies,GENDER 120,N/A,"No matter what class you take with her you will love her! She is an amazing teacher, she is flexible, and not a tough grader. I LOVE PROFESSOR BAYS!"
Sharon Bays,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,N/A,Anthro 137 is a must take for any UCLA student.   The readings she chooses is very interesting but at times could be too much.  The projects she assigns are interesting.  The only negative thing about her is that she can be intimidating at times but how many professors aren't.  Just take the class.  If you have anymore questions just email me.
Sharon Bays,NA,Women and Art in Contemporary U.S.,GENDER 139,N/A," I took W10 in spring 2010 with Dr. Bays. She's pretty nice and generous with assignments and grades. My TA was Naaz Diwan, and you might definitely want to be in her discussion; she's pretty laid-back and extremely nice about... everything, really. I did probably the bare minimum work for the class-- I did keep up with the weekly readings as much as I could. The class lecture might have been pretty slow and dull and random with the content, but the readings were actually quite insightful. I would only volunteer to speak up in class because the minutes of silence could get really frustrating. I'm not a humanities major, but if I were one I'd feel compelled to take in as much information and input my own knowledge to the class. But anyway, definitely take W10 with Dr. Bays. She offers extra review sessions, which are pretty key to acing the midterm and final. I reviewed my notes ONCE for the final, the night right before, and got a 99/100. I studied some more (not too much at all) for the midterm and got a 98/100. It's really just basic understanding of the issues, memorization, regurgitation, and an ounce of BS-ing skills. She's pretty catty about attendance, though, and one morning I got up about 15 minutes late and my roommate decided to use the restroom first to take a shower in the morning, so I just decided to not go to class at all to avoid the death glare.  I have a friend who took the same class with another professor and actually had an intensely stressful, overloaded-with-readings experience. You'll get a much more pleasant and easier time with Dr. Bays."
Sharon Bays,NA,Study of Social Systems,ANTHRO 140,N/A,"Very interesting class, albeit very disorganized since this was her first time teaching this course: we ended up reading about half of the articles in the course reader and completely scrapping one of our textbooks and a paper assignment. Thus for this class it was basically a midterm and final (both essay-based), and a short writing assignment. She distributes the essay prompts beforehand so you can prepare for them. Overall a very enlightening class with little work. Her lecture style is very gruesome: she sits at the podium and talks without any visual aid, so you need to be a very fast note-taker to get down everything she says."
Sharon Bays,NA,Women in Socialist and Post-Socialist States,GENDER M166,N/A,"I took her for WS10 in Spring 2010. The class is extremely easy TRUST. She is a little intimidating during lectures (there was once an argument about condoms...) but other than that she basically gives you a review/lecture on whats going to be on the midterm/final beforehand (literally she goes over the study guide step by step). Her lectures are extremely interesting and really made us think. I felt like I really learned from her lectures. I would try getting or buying the old midterms and essays because it was the same from the years before (hence A!). You should buy the book and the coursereader because thats what discussion is all about and she does ask you for citations. Try to get Freda as your TA, SHES AWESOME!"
Sharon Bays,NA,Theoretical Behavioral Ecology,ANTHRO 185A,N/A,"Disregard the course option I listed.  I took AAS187C with her, the Hmong class as people like to call it, and I was not completely satisfied.  While Bays is knowledgeable on the topic based on her past experiences, she fails to cater to what the students expect from the course, let alone an Asian American Studies course.  Granted she is an anthropology/women's studies teacher, a lot of her lectures are drawn from her background knowledge from those fields.  I've come to realize that I really detest anthro from taking her class.  If she ever does teach this course again, I would take it for the sake of learning (slightly) more about the Hmong people... however this has to be one of my least favorite classes within my major.  Her lectures were pretty dry, and we honestly did not even talk about the Hmong most of the time.  She is pretty cold during class, but I hear she warms up more during office hours.  Give it a go if you'd like."
Aomar Boum,NA,Study of Culture,ANTHRO 130,A-," This class was ""study of culture"" but he essentially treated it like those classes ending in 9, so it was really ""anthropology of sport."" There were usually 2-4 readings per week about mid-long length. Each week we had to submit questions to our TA as proof of having read the papers, but this wasn't a huge percentage of our grade.  There were 3 assignments: 1 to observe a sports game, 1 to interview/analyze an interview of an athlete, and 1 to write a biography on an athlete. Each of these assignments required us to apply core concepts. These were the bulk of the grade. They weren't too bad, but it depends on the TA that grades it. They were all also group assignments, so individually not that much work. Aomar Boum was a pretty decent lecturer. He didn't record the lectures, but he did upload slides. The slides didn't have a lot of information either so if you wanted to learn the material you had to go to lecture. I'm not sure how often this class is taught, but it wasn't very high stakes. It was easy and the topic was interesting. I would take it again."
Aomar Boum,NA,Anthropology of Religion,ANTHRO 142P,N/A,"This course has a HUGE focus on Islam and is not a general anthropology of religion class. He is a very disorganised lecturer and the exams are tough, he offered a makeup for the midterm but was very misleading about its format and content. He also said there would be two short answers in the final - turns out this was actually 2 22 mark essays worth half your grade. The final was full of mistakes. He takes a long time to post slides online and they often miss out key information and terms. Interesting content and readings but would not recommend due to the poor organisation and standard of the exams."
Aomar Boum,NA,Anthropology of Religion,ANTHRO 142P,B,"This class should be called Anthropology of Islam. As much as I found it interesting, his lectures are not clear at all  and he scribbles incoherent things on the board. His expectations are sometimes unrealistic and he purposefully tricked half of our class when it came to a midterm makeup exam. Take this class at your own risk."
Aomar Boum,NA,Ethnic and Religious Minorities,ANTHRO 142Q,A,"Professor Boum is a really nice, approachable guy, and though boring and long sometimes his lectures could also be intersting. If you need an easy A this is an okay class. His biggest downfall is his disorgaization and lack of clarity. He has the most confusing powerpoint slides and though he puts them online, not everything on them matters and he lectures a lot of important details that arent on the slides. He claims to have required readings but I never read them, I just studied the study guide and googled most of the terms, (though one the first midterm, when he said study which countries the different groups reside, everyone though he meant the main ones we focused on, but then he tested us on a bunch of sub-groups that I doubt anyone knew). I got an A in the class probably because he has like 25% of free points and the exams aren't that difficult if you memorize the study guide. But there is a group essay as a final, and I think I just got lucky with group members that actually did their part, so be careful."
Adam Wetsman,NA,Evolution and Biology of Human Behavior,ANTHRO 124,N/A,Wetsman is pretty funny and interesting!! I learned so much from his class and he is very clear.  He's very approachable and answers emails at the speed of light. No joke. There is one midterm and one final with quizzes. Quizzes can be very annoying at times and the midterm and final are graded by a TA who is a bit harsh. You could feel like you have the right answer but find out that's not the case. I ended up getting a B+ in the course and I think it was because of the quizzes so try to do well on them! They are 20% of your grade! Keep up with your reading. The book is very interesting so it shouldn't be that hard.
Adam Wetsman,NA,Evolution and Biology of Human Behavior,ANTHRO 124,N/A," Easy class, and I mean that. There is no paper, and he gives you the questions to the midterm and the final beforehand. What else could you want? It's like being fed with a spoon! Without a doubt, the easiest way to get your requirement out the way, for both anthro AND bio majors! A must-take!"
Adam Wetsman,NA,Evolution and Biology of Human Behavior,ANTHRO 124,N/A," The midterm and the final are easy. Just focus on the answers to the questions in Prof. Wetsman's study guide, which he gives out conveniently a week before the test. While Wetsman says 6-8 sentences will be enough, I think that unless you have awesome information collation skills, you must be prepared to write long paragraphs. I have to say, though, that his quizzes are tricky. I did not get a solid 'A', even if I placed in the top ten for both the midterm and the final, because my quiz grade was at a 'B'. The class curve is not generous. Something I did not find too great was the grading. For our class, the midterm was graded by an outside grader (maybe because the teacher wants to be impartial?? It's like having a TA that you never will meet.) who is strict in assigning points but lax in the inspection of the exam itself.  The curve does not just apply to the overall grade per exam-- the responses in your essay are also on a curve, graded relative to the responses of other students, rather than on what you were able to write on the paper, how much of each question you answered. So if you think you addressed about 90% of one question, guess again; if someone answered it better, you will not get a 9/10 on that question. I don't know if there was also an outside grader for the final. The professor is a very nice guy, very helpful, answers emails very quickly. He speaks very clearly and he discusses well; however, he cannot hold attention very long. I found that even after 2 mocha lattes and a bottled starbucks frap two hours before class, I still fell asleep for about 15 minutes each meeting. And I doubt that it's because we have ""siesta"" in my culture."
Adam Wetsman,NA,Evolution and Biology of Human Behavior,ANTHRO 124,N/A,"Prof. Wetsman is very funny:) I am not an Anthro  major, I just took the class because the time was convinient. However, he made the class seem very interesting. I've learned a lot of useful and interesting information, like why children fight with their parents and why people cheat, and why having low waist to hip ration for women is attractive to men, ect... I thought this was an easy class, with one midterm and a final. He also gave 6  10 point quizes which were really easy. He gives a study guide before the tests, and all of the questions are either derectly form the study guide or are a little bit modified versions of the study guide.  This class does not have a discussion section, which I thought is an awsome thing. No need to waist time with TAs :))jk. The professor is there for the sutdents 24/7, if they have any questons.  I would defenetly recomend this class to everyone."
Adam Wetsman,NA,Evolution and Biology of Human Behavior,ANTHRO 124,N/A,"I completely agree with the last comment.  This was the most frustrating class to have to sit through because he has no idea what he's talking about!!  I dreaded each moment that someone raised their hand to ask a question...because the answer got us NOWHERE.  The quizzes are the dumbest things in the world, but count for 15% of your grade...so even though I aced the midterm and final, I still ended up getting a B because of all those lame pop quizzes.  Again, not a fun class, don't take it, it'll drive you crazy. CRAZY!!"
Adam Wetsman,NA,Evolution and Biology of Human Behavior,ANTHRO 124,N/A,"NEVER TAKE THIS PROFESSOR unless you want to learn about his dumb family! He is not even  full-time faculty which means he does not have office hours.  you want a copy of the midterm questions and finals they are in the bank exam and they are the same every year.  Yet he is very picky with his questions and he thinks he is funny but he only talks about his family and his teaching at some community college.  If he likes it so much he should stay there since he is not a very effective TEACHER, he does have all these PhDs but then again I don't see a book written by him or anything else published but the only 3 sentences section in the only one book he makes you read.  I wonder why? Maybe because that is the only thing that he has been lucky to get published.  DON'T BOTHER ON ASKING QUESTIONS IN CLASS! Most likely he will say...""I can't think of any study right now... OR... the study did not test that and I am not sure.""  RANDOM QUIZES, he gives out quizzes every now and then so you HAVE to go to class other wise you won't go and he will be all alone.   He does not drop the lowest score and no extra credit to help you. Go spend your tuition money in another Anthro Class do yourself a favor.  TO THE COMMENT above, he was probably the reader."
Angeline N Gunawardena,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"I took IDS 100A this past fall with her and on the up side, it was hands down the EASIEST class I've ever taken at UCLA. On the down side, she is the WORST professor I've ever had. This was the last class I needed for IDS and I've definitely had some inspiring professors. The professor is intensely cynical and is unbeliavably biased. She loathes all the big boys in development such as the IMF, WB, UN and presents her material with an utter hate for neoliberal economic policies. She digresses a lot, her lectures are unorganized and broad and she does not she offer any strong, objective, academic insight into core IDS subjects. Her exams are in multiple choice format/some short answer and are extremely easy; however, that's only because finding the correct answer is not hard since the exams are biased and it always ends up being the most cynical option. I think I would be ok with her if she was just another bad professor, but her one-sided analysis makes me dislike her more. "
Angeline N Gunawardena,NA,Introduction to Development Studies: Economic Development and Culture Change,INTL DV 100A,N/A,"This professor has some really cool field experience she shares during lectures.  She does have a really awful lecturing style though.  Its like she's reading from a book and it can be hard to want to focus sometimes.  She includes all the information you need for the tests though and the tests are really quite easy if you pay attention.  She's not trying to give bad grades so if you want to you can do well.  She's usually quite eager to help students so if you need something clarified just ask.  I wish she could make the subject a little more interesting since its something I'm very interested in, she kinda sucks the life out of it, but the class is doable.  "
Angeline N Gunawardena,NA,Gender Systems: Global,ANTHRO M154Q,N/A," This is an AMAZING professor!  I took her Globalization/Gender Systems course over the summer and it was truly an eye-opening experience.  Most of the topics covered are political/current events issues and aren't the most pleasant to deal with, such as globalization of production, neoliberal economic policies, gender subordination, food insecurity, malnutrition and gender issues relating to HIV/AIDS, but these are topics everyone needs to know about and if one is dealing with these types of issues, rarely are they ""fun.""  Professor Gunewardena assigned a lot of reading for this course (no textbooks, all material was obtained via downloads/links) and while at times it was voluminous, all of it was worthwhile reading and completely relevant to each week's subject area. During the course, we viewed 3 films and were required to write analyses of each; these assignments combined were worth 30% of our grade.  Again, each of the films was on target with the subject area for the week.  Attendance counted for 10% of our grade and informed participation in classroom discussions counted for 10%.  The final was essay-based, there were 5 essay questions (1 for each week of topics covered beyond introduction to concepts) and counted for 50% of our grade.   There were several students who complained repeatedly (but NOT to the Professor!) about being required to participate in discussion because it was not a 5 unit class and there was no discussion section assigned, which I personally felt was uncalled for and really immature.  Last time I checked, being a student at UCLA meant that we are all expected to read the required materials, assimilate the readings and be able to at least ask questions in class about things we don't understand and/or be able to participate in discussion in class concerning the current topic.  What's so hard about that?  What's the point of going to class and simply being a note-taker?  People who don't want to be actively involved in their education and make the most of it should probably give up their much-desired seat at UCLA and try online college or ""distance learning"" where they won't have to be accountable for actually thinking or being involved.   I would not rate Professor Gunewardena as a difficult teacher because the term implies to me someone who practices academic terrorism, which she does not.  Nor does she try to trick her students on tests, nor does she make the subject matter incomprehensible.  On the contrary, if you are a person who is not up-to-date on all things political, or current events (like me!), she makes it possible to understand sometimes nebulous concepts such as gender constructs, agency, resistance and subordination which are necessary for the course. Professor Gunewardena is obviously extremely intelligent and really knows her stuff.  She is very dedicated to her field and her work.  Her enthusiasm is contagious.  I had another professor the same quarter who was the chair of their department (and obviously tenured), and while this person is a long-time professor at UCLA, Professor Gunewardena stood in stark, positive contrast to this person as a superior teacher.  She takes time to learn each student's name and is genuinely concerned that each student is learning and understanding the concepts of the course.  She makes somewhat unpleasant subject matter interesting and engaging, and is a highly effective teacher.  She is always available in her office hours and let us know beforehand if she would be away from them on a particular day.  She kept in touch via e-mail and was responsive to e-mails sent to her.   I cannot say enough good things about Professor Gunewardena and would highly recommend this course, and this professor, to anyone who wants to have a great learning experience at UCLA.  She is the type of professor, and person, that one would remember with admiration years after graduation.  Women everywhere of all ages should be thankful there are feminists like her that make our lives more pleasant because of her dedication and accountability."
Angeline N Gunawardena,NA,Theoretical Behavioral Ecology,ANTHRO 185A,N/A," I DID NOT TAKE 185A this thing wasn't letting em post without selecting something. When I took her first class in spring of 2009 on Gender and Development IDS 191, I was uncertain about the focus I wanted in development.  My regional focus I knew was Pakistan, but the country has so many problems, my main question was:  Where can I start. Professor Nandani’s course was able to answer most of my questions.  After three weeks I knew I wanted to aspire to be just like her. Empowering women in rural Pakistan has become my passion. Professors Nandin’s course lectures helped me realize my passion in the field of gender and development. I was able to critically reflect on readings for the course and could apply them to case studies. One of the major reasons as to why no professor has been able to inspire me the way professor Nandini has is because she teaches with passion. Her main goal is to make sure that when we leave UCLA we are fully equipped to take on our responsibilities as developers. She simplifies concepts for us in such a way that the concepts never leave our minds. They form the core development frameworks that I keep in mind whenever I have carried out research. She is an incredible mentors and advisor. I can practically talk to her about anything, and will always leave the room feeling empowered, strong, inspired and purposeful. I am currently doing an independent study under her guidance on “Women in Poverty in Pakistan”. The purpose of this project is so that I find a focus on an area within the field of gender and development. Despite her busy schedule professor Nandani has taken out the time to help me in my project because she believes that we as IDS students strive for something meaningful and can bring out about change. In my case she believes in my endeavors and recognizes the sincerity and commitment I have towards eliminating poverty on Pakistan. It is my wish to have Professor Gunewardena as an advisor in grad school. Unfortunately, UCLA does not have a development program.Professor Nandani has an understanding that a lot of professors who teach IDS courses don not have. This has a lot to do with the fact that she has so much on the ground experience but also because she herself has roots in a developing country, Srilanka. She genuinely feels for the injustices and inequalities that exist in developing countries while understanding the cultural and social limitations that exist.  I will recommend taking all of her classes. Professor Nandini is a very fair grader and her exams are constructed so that she tests our core concepts... she is not interested in tricking students and making us write and write for hours. There are a very few classes at UCLA from i which i have actually ""learned"" soemthinhg... so if you are interesting in learning and being inspired at the same time TAKE HER CLASSSS!!!! SHE IS AWESOME!"
Angeline N Gunawardena,NA,Theoretical Behavioral Ecology,ANTHRO 185A,N/A," I took Professor Gunewardena in Winter 2009 for an IDS 191 senior seminar on Gender Issues in International Development. Professor Gunewardena was one of the most dynamic professors I had at UCLA. Her classroom discussions were unparalleled. She gave her absolute best to us each time we met and always respected our intelligence and saw to it that everyone participated. And she took the time to learn all of our names!  The course was very well structured and I felt as though the readings, weekly assignments and the senior thesis though they were all very time consuming were of the caliber that I had come to expect at UCLA. But what impressed me most beyond the excellent readings, lectures and discussions, was Professor Gunewardena's depth and breadth of knowledge and experience in International Development combined with her optimism and compassion. It's so easy to fall into the the trappings of pessimism and anger in this line of academic inquiry as one reads about all of the injustices that have taken place and continue to take place in our world. Professor Gunewardena has the rare gift of inspiring her students with knowledge, passion, compassion and hope. And for that I will be forever indebted to her.  "
Angeline N Gunawardena,NA,Theoretical Behavioral Ecology,ANTHRO 185A,N/A,"I took IDS 100A and IDS 191 with this professor (the drop-down menu on this site won't let me choose it). I wish I were able to take more courses with her because she is intelligent, insightful, extremely socially conscious, and a very effective professor. She really gets her students to not only learn the material but to also go beyond what we learn in the classroom and prepare us as professionals in International Development. She does so by equipping us with the knowledge, tools, and analytical type of thinking that is required in the field. I would recommend her as a professor to anyone who is willing to put in the effort and truly learn and grow as a student. Her courses are very manageable if you do not slack off as she expects insight from her students. Professor Gunewardena is the type of professor that pushes and inspires her students. I admire her very much!"
Angeline N Gunawardena,NA,Variable Topics Research Seminars: Anthropology,ANTHRO 191,N/A,"Professor Gunewardena made an expected course interesting and very relatable. Her lectures weren't mundane as those of many other professors who just like to hear themselves talk... and I looked forward to them even at 9 in the morning. Although she gave a lot to read and the material wasn't exactly like reading your favorite book while sipping on an ice coffee, she did a great job deciphering all the ""development jargon"", as she called it, to us during lecture. Thus, she ensured that we actually UNDERSTOOD everything that we read and not just expect us to take all of it because we are ""college students."" And if you are ever have an issue, you can always count on a lot of help during her office hour! She is very personable and friendly and is willing to help you out with everything! Team Nandini! "
Angeline N Gunawardena,NA,Variable Topics Research Seminars: Anthropology,ANTHRO 191,N/A,"I took IDS 191-Disaster Capitalism in the summer 2009. I really enjoyed the class but the midterm was very confusing. I think the seminar format is a great idea and really got all of us to read. However, the lecture left me a little ill-prepared for the mid-term. (Most of the other students did really poorly, too.) It was disappointing because the subject matter was really interesting. By the end of the course I think that most people had a good grip on the general ideas introduced in the class. Some students struggled because she is demanding in the 191 classes because it's a SENIOR SEMINAR! We were asked to do a fair amount of reading and then do analysis. She asks every student to share original ideas, based in the readings, EVERY time you meet. It's not hard work but one is asked to stay on top of it. Be prepared to do a bit of work and thinking. With all of this is mind, Prof. G is very fair and not out to get anybody in a bind. Meet with her in office hours, find a study buddy and talk about the class. Lectures are a bit ""stream of consciousness"" but nevertheless interesting and engaging if you're interested in the subject matter. If not, don't take this class. You'll suffer."
Angeline N Gunawardena,NA,Research for Ph.D. Dissertation,ANTHRO 599,N/A,"I had her for IDS100A, and she's really nice, extremely compassionate.  If you ever get confused on the exams, big multinationals are evil and the little guy is getting squished.  So, yes, she is pretty biased in that sense, and the entire class is based on this premise: LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE POOR VILLAGERS.  That said, make sure you attend class.  She outlines all the readings pretty clearly so that reading is more or less optional.  Midterms and exams are regurgitation."
Sondra Hale,NA,Women and Social Movements,ANTHRO M145R,N/A,"This lady is the REAL DEAL!  Her CV is a mile long, listing books, articles and reviews published, involvement in symposiums and the like, and involvement in an entire range of other activities, from the arts to field work in Africa.  She is an extremely well-rounded person who brings her world experiences to the classroom.  What strikes me as most impressive about Prof. Hale is not her very extensive education or her publications (although those are most impressive), but rather her kind soul and depth of heart -- she truly cares about people and what is going on in the world.  I took her Women in Social Movements Class and it was a real eye-opening experience.  She is an excellent lecturer and gives assignments that require research and truly make one think.  She is a feminist in the truest, most positive sense of the word and every woman should thank their own Divine Being there are ladies out there like Prof. Hale who have paved the way for the rest of us to have what liberties we do in this world.  Highly recommended -- she is one of those professors you remember fondly the rest of your life."
Tritia Toyota,NA,Contemporary Asian American Communities,ASIA AM 20,N/A,See Tricia Toyota
Tritia Toyota,NA,Contemporary Asian American Communities,ASIA AM 20,N/A,"The lecture was okay. The writing assignments were much easier compared to what I expected. You do read a lot (if you actually do), but just listen to the lectures and attend discussions for a good grade. This class was enjoyable."
Tritia Toyota,NA,Contemporary Asian American Communities,ASIA AM 20,N/A," Although her lectures can be a bit dry, Professor Toyota is great. She is really nice during office hours and tries to get you genuinely interested in social studies.  Because she was a news journalist, she is very knowledgeable and tells personal stories.  Your grade is composed of a midterm and three papers. The midterm is pretty easy because she gives you study questions. If you answer the questions and study it, you'll be fine.  The first two papers are very simple; it's only one page and you answer four questions. The last paper is your ""final"" and is only 5 pages.  This class isn't too bad in terms of workload.  She assigns readings every week. The first half of the readings are important because it relates to the midterm; the second half aren't that important because you can just read the ones that directly relate to your paper. Most people just stopped showing up to lecture after the midterm.  All in all, it was a good GE. Should be an easy A if you do your work."
Tritia Toyota,NA,Contemporary Asian American Communities,ASIA AM 20,N/A," Although Professor Toyota can be repetitive since she would summarize the assigned readings, she is still a great professor since she would share her stories as a former journalist and emphasize how social science skills are necessary and are still used out there in the vast variety of jobs. The readings she assigned were excellent choices because they were interesting to read. And the book she told to us to buy isn't necessary, but I would buy it since it has some interesting articles to read if you're highly interested in Asian American communities. To supplement the readings, she would show us videos or invite guest speakers. The grade of the class is usually composed of an in-class essay midterm based on the assigned readings and two assignments that contribute to your final essay. The workload isn't heavy unless you plan to keep up with the readings. Furthermore, if you think this would be an easy solid A, you have to understand the grading requirements of your TA. I should had received a B+ in the class, but I got an A- instead since Professor Toyota promised a grade bump if your TA recognized you for participating in or showing up for discussions. "
Tritia Toyota,NA,Contemporary Asian American Communities,ASIA AM 20,N/A," As a professor, she's alright. I found her lectures to be a bit dry and repetitive, but she does throw in some humor once in a while and she does have a lot of knowledge about Asian American communities. Your grade is made up of a ""community narrative"" (a proposal, a draft, and a final paper) and a midterm. The midterm is composed of questions that relate to the assigned readings. You need to incorporate 5 readings into your final paper, but unless you can't read, there really is no point in going to lecture after the midterm.  Oh. And don't buy the book. It's a waste of $11. You won't touch it; I promise."
Tritia Toyota,NA,,ASIA AM 172C,N/A,"Big heart. I remember the night in 1985 when she had to report the death of Ricky Nelson on an otherwise happy occasion, New Years evening. She lost her composure and could not hold back her tears through the breaking news. As the credits rolled, they played Rick's ""Easy to be Free"", a good choice for Rick's swan song.... Thanks for the memories, Trish."
Tritia Toyota,NA,,ASIA AM 172C,N/A," Anthro 167. Narcissistic, loves herself too much. lectures, discussion session and reading are irrelevant to the project assigned.  TA are not aware what is going on in the class (they themselves never do the readings) so they don't know what to discuss. (the readings are too hard and really make no sense to any of us. Other elements of the class: Disorganized, The title doesn't stand for what we are supposed to do. In other words waist of time, money any nervs. Tritia might be good for other classes, but teach urban anthro is clearly not for her. "
Tritia Toyota,NA,"Special Courses in Comparative Race, Ethnicity, Gender, and Sexuality",ASIA AM 187D,N/A,"Toyota is a very nice professor.  She has a good background in news journalism so she definitely knows what she is talking about.  I took her class on ""Politics of Race & Media"" and it was great.  She grades fairly, and is not too hard to get a good grade if you work hard in the class.  Although some of the material was a bit dry, it's manageable with someone interested in media.  Just do the reading and take the practice questions for her short answers seriously, and there's no reason why you shouldn't get an A."
Serap Ruken Sengul,NA,Political Violence in the Modern World,CLUSTER 48A,A+,"Professor Sengul's lectures were very dense and hard to understand. I know other students would make comments about her accent and stuttering but imo that's very ableist and it was never a problem for me. However, she assigned very long and convoluted readings, and because her lectures were so hard to understand, they weren't great. I stopped going to her lectures after her third lecture during fall quarter. She's very very knowledgeable and that's evident through her lectures and everything else but she also speaks very fast during lectures and that makes it hard to understand what she is saying or even to grasp what she wants to convey to students. I respect her a lot and she is a very nice person but I did not enjoy her lectures at all. The other lecturers and TAs in the course are amazing, though, and that made this class my favourite during my first two quarters at UCLA. I would 100% recommend it."
Serap Ruken Sengul,NA,Political Violence in the Modern World,CLUSTER 48A,A+,"Professor Sengul was a deeply knowledgeable scholar of the subjects she taught, taking care to impart her deep understanding of core issues to her students. An amazing professor and an amazing person."
Serap Ruken Sengul,NA,Political Violence in the Modern World,CLUSTER 48A,A+," Dr. Sengul is very kind, but lectures very quickly and has very content-dense slideshows. At the beginning of the year, her accent was slightly difficult to understand, but you get used to it after a while. She taught the Armenian Genocide portion of the class, which was very interesting, but for many of us, we were not entirely familiar with the case study before coming into the class. At times, it felt like we needed more background context to understand what was happening and it felt as if we were jumping around to different time periods/people. Her assigned readings were also very dense and difficult to read in their entirety due to their length.  In general, I would definitely recommend this cluster! Regardless of the professor teaching, you do not need to attend lecture for this cluster since they are recorded and you are not tested on any of the information. Your grade depends on essays and discussion participation; there are no exams. The essays are relatively easy and usually ask you to use the assigned readings. Your grade will depend on your TA since they grade your essays and participation. I definitely recommend Yair Agmon! He is a very understanding and kind TA and a fair grader! I took his photography seminar for 48c and it was so much fun!"
Serap Ruken Sengul,NA,Political Violence in the Modern World,CLUSTER 48A,A-,"Professor Sengul has great intentions. You can tell that she is very passionate about what she teaches, but her lectures are almost impossible to understand. She has a very thick accent which is paired at a talking speed which sounds like you're listening to the lecture on 2x. I don't even attempt to attend lecture because I can understand 4 words in each sentence. Her slides are very detailed, so it makes it easy to go back and teach yourself the material. She does not take in any criticism or questions in full."
Serap Ruken Sengul,NA,Political Violence in the Modern World,CLUSTER 48A,A,"I know that throughout the quarter, a lot of students ended up entirely skipping Sengul's lectures. When she teaches she frequently just reads paragraphs of text off of her slides. She also has an accent and speaks very fast which makes it hard to understand her. Personally, I felt that I could choose to either write what was on the slides or listen to what she was saying, which made lectures very frustrating. Her performance shouldn't reflect on the experience of the overall class, although she's difficult the rest of the class is very manageable, even if you have no interest in the content"
Serap Ruken Sengul,NA,Political Violence in the Modern World,CLUSTER 48A,A,"I've gone back to edit this review: I think I made comments about Professor Sengul's accent and stutter that were unfair and mean-spirited, thank you to the other reviewer for calling me out. It's a combination of the fact that Professor Sengul wants to introduce her students to a very high level of concepts in Anthopology and that sometimes her verbiage combined with stutters makes it hard to understand (yes this is still abelist but I find it to be the truth).  But you don't need to worry too much about not understanding all of her stuff. My TA Julia did a great job unpacking what she said. This cluster is still a very doable A and probably my favorite experience at UCLA after 2 years in. In regards to Sengul, you will learn so much you didn't know about Late Ottoman history and the Armenian Genocide itself, which is exactly what the class is for. She puts so much text on her slides that reading that alone was enoguh to teach me the concepts neeeded. She is always willing to kindly elaborate and help you in office hours, I think she'd have a fantastic and rigorous seminar if she decides to teach it again."
Serap Ruken Sengul,NA,Special Topics in Gender Studies,GENDER 185,A+,"I have taken two different GS 185 classes with professor Sengul and I would gladly take more! She is absolutely brilliant, but I've found this is part of why people find her confusing. She asks the class complex, abstract, and philosophical questions that can sometimes be hard to fully comprehend without dissecting each part of the question. While the questions she poses may be challenging she really doesn't ask very much from people and her assignments are not any more challenging than other GS classes. She assigns interesting readings, she uses slides, and she is extremely kind, accommodating, and helpful! In my experience, she enjoys talking with students and is happy to help. She is so passionate about what she teaches and you can tell she really wants students to succeed."
Serap Ruken Sengul,NA,Special Topics in Gender Studies,GENDER 185,A-,"DO NOT TAKEI had to stay in the class because literally everything else was full I checked every department to get out of this class but nothing was open.She will shut you down if you ask questions, she has too many thoughts going on and tries to explain them all at once and you are left just wondering what she is talking about. I literally could not understand what she was saying  it was so frustrating. Take this class if you are ready to teach yourself everything and the readings she assigns are heavy and LONG.Avoid if you can"
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"This class was INCREDIBLY easy. She co-wrote the textbook that the class uses and her lectures are podcasted, so you never need to go to lecture. Just read the book, go to section, and you are sure to get an A. Her exams are extremely straightforward and nothing to worry about if you have given at least a little effort to the class. The material is interesting and presented in an organized fashion. Professor Silk is an effective lecturer and a wonderful professor!"
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A," I took anthro 7 with this professor and absolutely LOVED it. She is a great, engaging, funny professor who makes lectures enjoyable. The material is sooo sooo interesting. You definitely have to put work into it, though. DO not take this class as an easy G.E because it isn't. You need to read the book and probably skim over readings both before the midterm and final. Her practice midterm was very similar to the actual midterm so know that cold. Also, what helped me was that I did a lot of the questions in the back of teh chapters (even the ones that were not assigned). She uses a lot of those too. The answers to all of those questions can be found online. I went to office hours before the final for the first time and she was super nice and very helpful.... I only wish I went to more office hours before. Basically,if you want to learn a lot and don't mind doing the readings and putting effort into the class, I cannot recommend it enough. If you work hard, you'll get the A"
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Challenging, worthwhile GE. i missed a decent amount of lectures, but actually found them extremely helpful so tried not to miss them. i did however read the entire book cover to cover, which although somewhat tedious, was overall interesting and i think necessary to succeed in the class. Silk is extremely interested in anthro and you can tell when she teaches. i also took anthro 89 and it was an easy, moderately interesting A. i never had an interest in anthro, but following her course, i do. Take it if you want to learn and dont mind doing some work."
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A," This isn't an easy class, but its definitely doable, and definitely interesting.  You'll learn some pretty fascinating stuff about how evolution applies to modern behavior, like - why men prefer tend to favor good looks over resources (wealth) in potential mates, and why that pattern is reversed in women. The really interesting stuff only comes at the end, though, so don't be disappointed. If you want to know more you should read ""The Moral Animal"" by Richard Wright - about evolutionary psychology, i highly reccommend it. But anyway, its an interesting class, though there is some super boring stuff in the middle part about fossils and neanderthals and stuff like that.  In lecture, SIlk pretty much repeats what you just read in the textbook in her powerpoints. Her lectures are podcasted and the  powerpoints are posted online, so you really don't need to go to class at all - I didn't go to a single lecture after the 2nd week. You do need to read the book, though, and its a fair amount of reading, so you can't be lazy. However, the book is clearly written (she wrote it) and well organized, so its not too painful. structure of the class: section: 10%, midterm: 40%, final: 50%. section is mandatory, and there's homework due every week, but the TA you get doesn't matter much becuase all they do is go over the answers in section. As you can see, your grade pretty much depends on two tests, so its easy to mess up. DO the practice tests she gives you, and not just the night before the test. Also study the homework questions, because they usually cover the main concepts she wants you to understand. If you've read and studied, the tests are pretty straight forward; she doesn't throw any random or trick questions at you. Overall, its a good class. If you're looking for an interesting but slightly challenging ge, take it. "
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Silk is a boring lecturer, but I thought the material was fairly interesting. Her lectures were podcasted so there wasn't much incentive to go to lecture... however, make sure you study her practice exams before you take her midterms and final. She always wants very specific answers on her tests. If it's possible, it might be helpful to find exams that she's given in the past, to get an idea of what she wants. Both of the exams are also curved. She always responded to my e-mails and was willing to answer my questions, as well. "
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"I never went to any lectures, but the course is on Bruincast and powerpoints are posted. Alot of the questions are from the practice she handed out so it is straight forward. I dont know what the other person is talking about...it isn't a premed class. "
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Definitely do NOT recommend taking this class as a GE; it's a pre-med pre-req, so you can imagine the level of competition. The lectures are interesting enough, but 90% of your grade is based on the midterm and final, so if you do poorly on one there's really nowhere to make up for it. The average grade on the midterm was around a 60%, though the class is curved. As far as the material is concerned, it really did nothing to convince me that evolution is a legitimate possibility for the origin of human life...in fact, it probably did the opposite. There's a lot of molecular genetics material covered in the first half of the course, which could be good or bad depending on if that's your forte. If you want an easy A, this isn't the place to look!"
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"I loved, loved, loved this course!!! I am into all the evolution stuff so I think that helped me connect with the material. I also am a science major so I had a bit of background with genetics and evolution to begin with. The class works like this lecture 3x a week, one midterm, one final, 10 HW assignments form the book due in discussion, super easy and the answers are on the web to confer with. I am not going to say this class is easy, easy. I read the book cover to cover and reviewed and attended lecture every day, but I really liked the book and found the stuff to be interesting so I was motivated. My TA was great. Midterms are all short answer questions, however I have looked at previous year midterm and they are almost identical! So pick some of those up and you will be fine. Concepts are easy to learn and for once make sense, unlike HNMR- in O chem.. ugh! Silk is very into her subject and really thinks all this stuff is fascinating and i agree! I loved learning and appreciating the human race!!! It is a wonderful class and I had a wonderful experience. There is a curve, so even if you don't do very well on the MT its not the end of the world. The final was 14 questions, it was dense and intense, but I honestly mastered the class and material. I would really recommend Anthro 7 with Silk if you want a great class that will really foster your growth as a college student in understanding where we come from and why we act the way we do! "
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Man where do I start? First off, the class was pretty interesting I'm not going to lie, but this women spent her entire life studying primates so you could imagine how strenuous the class was. I only saw the lecture full three times: 1st day of class, midterm day, final day, heck I was rarely there. The tests are harder then you think. Short answer, but you really have to read the book to get a good grade in the class. In discussion, my TA was too smart for her own good, and only confused us more, so that kind of made the class a little more difficult. Definitely choose and good time and go because it's mandatory. Honestly, you can get away with not going to lecture and just reading the book and going to section. Meet with people in your section before the test and make study guides and you should be fine."
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A," She's an ok lecturer. The lectures weren't that boring. Yes, all her slides and class videos are posted online. Homework wasn't so bad because the TAs give you credit for doing it. My TA didn't really check our answers. We just got points for going to discussion ON TIME and turning in our homework.  HOWEVER I don't understand the professor's grading. On both the midterm and final, I really thought I did well, but the grades I got on both weren't what I expected. Maybe there were certain answers she was looking for and I didn't put down. I really thought I knew all the material..I guess she was looking for something else. But nonetheless, midterm grades are curved and the final grades are also curved. I expected to get an A, but ended with a B+ . Take this class if you're interested in macroevolution. It was not my favorite class."
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Prof Silk is a good lecturer and her slides are easily comprehensible. She posts all slides before lecture, so you can print them out and follow along while she talks. She gives good examples and lots of charts/graphs to help you understand the material. The midterm was a bit tricky. I thought it would be pretty easy because I felt like I understood the material, but the exam questions were a bit vague and it was unclear what exactly she was looking for. I know a lot of people lost points because they didn't say exactly what she wanted even though they understood the concept. Her re-grade policy is that you have to submit a written statement about why your answer is correct and why you deserve more points. This class is definitely intersting, and although the 2nd half can be a bit tedious, it's good stuff to know."
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"I hated this class! Her lectures were like listening to a primate! She would just read off her silyl slides the whole time and put you to sleep. I stopped going to lecture because it didn't help at all. 90% of the class is based on the midterm and final, which all consisted of essay questions which were very vague. Also, my TA was extremely boring and vague..didn't help. STAY AWAY!!"
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A," The subject, human evolution, is really interesting and kind of fun because after taking it you can argue beat anyone who doesn't believe in evolution in an argument. Prof Silk is a decent lecturer. She's understandable and keeps on topic. A few complaints about how she purposely made some things politically correct and a couple of test questions that were incomprehensible - that kind of thing really pisses me off, when it turns out you really knew the answer to a test question but it was worded so badly that you couldn't figure out what it was asking. No reason not to take her class, but I wouldn't go out of my way for her."
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"When I took this class, I thought it would boring and just another one of those GEs you have to take in order to graduate. However, this class turned out to be pretty interesting. Prof. Silk lectures are clear and very well organized. She posts all the slides online, her tests are fair and rather straightforward. The homework assigned every week are short and will help you for the tests. The class is curved: 40% got B+ or higher, 28% got at least A-. In sum, it is a great GE: interesting and easy, plus the professor is very good at teaching it..."
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"I liked professor Silk, but I very much disliked the course. The midterm average was very low and both the midterm and the final were nothing but memorization. I agree, who care about the difference between homo erectus and homo ergaster, but it's true, the professor needs to teach this material. I took it as a GE and though it was interesting at times, I sort of wish I had taken another class. To get an A in the class, do the following: make note cards of every lecture slide and memorize all of them, and read the book. Sounds easier than it is. I felt bad for Professor Silk because only half of the class went to lecture. I recommend going to lecture because you learn much more by going to lecture than just looking at the lecture notes online. If you did well in AP Biology in high school, you should have no problem in this class."
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"I would not recommend this class as a GE.  There is a lot of memorization and if evolution turns out to not be your thing I can see how this class would suck.  However, I am a Psych major so I had to take it and I LOVED Professor Silk.  I am so  pleased I took it with her.  If you can I recommend taking the honors section the readings she chooses though sometimes long are amazing, and really served useful as little extras to add to my answers on the midterm and final.  Silk's lectures can sometimes seem long and tedious because who really cares about the dentition of Paranthropus boisei but that's not her fault.  This class was definitely not the easiest I've taken, the midterm was long but the questions she asks are fair, I was not surprised by any of the questions on the midterm or the final.  Do the readings and go to lecture though, and do the hominin worksheet she posts online memorizing that thing is VERY helpful for the final.  Overall if you study the questions in the back of the book and can remember stressed examples from lecture you should ace the class no problem."
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,this class sux......studying for the midterms and final sux. the final is cumulative and memorizing all the hominids and their derived traits sucks even more.  WHo cares whats the differennce between sahelthropus tchadensis and orrorin tugenensis..i certainly dont.... arghhh.. good luck to whoever has to take this class
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Her lectures were organized, concise and interesting.  The required text was written by her, and was an easy reading.  Her tests were really easy because she asked general/basic concepts which were the obvious topics in class.  I studied a few hours before the tests and scored in the top 5% of class.  Seriously, it was one of my favorite and easiest classes."
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A, i think this course was pretty easy...just study ur lecture notes for midterm..then u'll do fine.. and also.. the finals.. don't get fooled by the sample questions she gives out. i thought the fanals is going to be from the sample questions... but none  of the questions were from the sample questions! argghh!!! just study on ur own for the finalslecture notes!!!!
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"It's not a hard class but it's boring. Lectures are a waste of time since her presentations are posted on line. Make sure you study for the tests because almost the entire grade rests on the midterm and final. I'd say, don't take it unless you have to; it's not a fun GE."
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Professor Silk is so organized! All the lecture slides are posted on the web for students to download, which just became my excuse for not attending lecture. I went to all lecture until the first midterm, and then I started going more and more sporadically. However, I still ended up with a high A. I'd say that if you attend lecture, memorize lecture notes, memorize homework problems and review problems, you'll nab an A."
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Prof Silk is very organized, interesting, knowledgable and nice. It's easy to miss lectures,,, but try not to cuz u will remember info better (plus its interesting material) the class fairly easy... u need to study for midterms and final but there is a curve (also view the lecture slides online before exams) overall this class very informative and fun."
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Silk wrote the book for her class. So if you missed lecture once in a while, it wasn't a big deal(her book is VERY well written and easy to follow). It was a really fun class, and she is super organized and effective. The material was pretty easy and really interesting, just make sure you show up to lecture and lab. The homework was pretty easy, as was the midterm and final. Just make sure you study a bit for those, because they're worth 90% of your grade(40% midterm, 50% final). Overall, I really enjoyed her class, so definitely take this if you're a Psych major. It's like overgeneralizing human behavior on other primates."
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,her lectures are a good nap
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Silk is a very intelligent professor who knows what she is talking about.  Sometimes she may breeze over her slides quickly, expecting you to catch them.  Just make sure you have a great TA (Leisa) who will help you.  The midterm and finals are tricky, not what you expect.  A lot was based on ""special lectures"" not out of the book."
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Worst class ever.  I always attend lecture for every class but I couldnt manage to go to her lectures because she merely reads the overheads that she puts online.  The reading is tedious and when asked about the material in the book that she wrote, which is the required text, she often couldnt explain it.  Although the class was easy, it was sooooo boring."
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,I did not like this class at all.  I thought that the book was dreadful and the lectures were simply a regurgitation of the horrible textbook.  The only good thing about the class was that it had a huge curve.
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,Professor Silk is very knowledgebale on the material she lectures.  The first half of the class did not seem very interesting since you just go over concepts and theories.  I found that the second half of the class was a lot more interesting because you discuss topics that are a bit more contemporary.  Regarding the tests I recommend that you keep up with the readings but do tend to focus a little more on the lectures that she posts on the class website.  She also holds a raffle to show some of the concepts that she discussed during lecture but all this goes down at the ned of the quarter.  If a student wins the raffle the student wins $100 dollars cash.  So that part of the class was kind of fun.  This class is graded on a curve so try to do your best since ultimately the students are competing against each other.
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Overall Professor Silk really knows what she is talking about.  She should...she wrote the book! Lectures are somewhat boring, but if you are a psych major you should take this class because a lot of the material is psych related.  There are weekly homeworks, but everybody gets full credit pretty much.  Attending section is mandatory, so make sure you choose a good time.  Towards the end of the class, Silk seemed a bit burnt out.  Take this class if you want to learn about monkeys.  The material is a bit dry, but you definitely don't need to read the book.  This class is an easy B and a bit harder A.  Tests are short answer and essays, but nothing to be too concerned about."
Joan B Silk,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Anthro 7 is very interesting, but the material is hard to absorb all at once. As a professor, Silk is very organized and effective in teaching. Her lectures may be quite boring since she just reads off her power points. However, it is helpful that she puts it online and she has links on the webpage that are very useful. Take the class if you can handle a lot of reading and info. If you're lazy, forget about it!"
Joan B Silk,NA,Great Adaptations: Origins of Complexity in Nature,ANTHRO 125A,N/A,"She likes to give a bunch of essay exams, the grading is pretty awful and the exams are long. I recommend you pass. Take something better like 124p or 124b."
Joan B Silk,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,N/A,"Prof. Silk is one of the best professors I've ever had, probably one of my favorites. She is funny, intelligent, and very approachable. I took Anthro 7 and 128A. These classes were not easy, but you get so much out of them! She's funny, and engaging, and got me interested in primatology!  I liked her upper division class (128A) better because it focused on non-human primates. The concepts and experiments you learn about are amazing and really get you thinking about our own humanity. You also have to go to the zoo observing primates for one project and observe dogs at a dog park for another. This part is fun and easy as she doesn't ask for too much. Also, Prof. Silk gave us the exam before the midterm and we split the questions up within our group of 4 and studied that way for the exam. She did the same for the final. I got a B+ in Anthro 7 and an A- in 128A. Trust me, take a class with this Professor! "
Joan B Silk,NA,"Marriage, Family, and Kinship",ANTHRO M145P,N/A,Silk is a great teacher for this class.  She is knowledgable and her tests are fair.  Make sure you attend lecture and learn the lecture notes well cause her questions come straight from that.  I always had them printed and reviewed them for the midterm and final which really really helped cause I got an A on both. The reading is optional(in my opinion) cause the lecture highlights what you need to know from the readings. She taught this class with another Prof. Levine(also great and fair teacher)
Akhil Gupta,NA,Anthropology of Food,ANTHRO 133,A+,"The premise of this class is interesting, but I took this online (S21) and it was extremely dry. The lectures were recorded but I stopped watching them after the few few weeks without any issues. The assignments were fairly light and easy. There was a food diary, a reflection on a book about medical anthropology, and then you could either write one long paper+1 short reflection on the readings or do 4 short reflections. They were all graded fairly easily. There were definitely a lot of ""required"" readings, but unless it's for a paper, you only really needed to skim them. Professor Gupta is not a great lecturer and does not engage much but he is very well connected in his field and we had some interesting guest lecturers. Overall, it was not a great experience but was a pretty easy A."
Akhil Gupta,NA,Anthropology of Food,ANTHRO 133,B,Enjoyed this class. Highly recommend!
Akhil Gupta,NA,Anthropology of Food,ANTHRO 133,A-,"I found the class to be very interesting. The workload is A LOT but after the first two articles, the material itself is easy to understand. You don't have to attend lectures but you NEED to go to discussion because you receive a participation grade. End of quarter survey gave me 4% EC even though he says he doesn't give out extra credit and curving is in your favor.  His English is not the best and that translates on his tests through tricky questions. Both the midterm and the final had 6 answer options (4 regular and the other two were all of the above or none of the above). Just do all the readings and you can get an A. I didn't study for any of the tests but I never fell behind on the readings. Selling all books $4 eachtext me 510-756-9929"
Akhil Gupta,NA,Anthropology of Food,ANTHRO 133,A-," Cool class. Ate ass. The content of the course is interesting, but I found the lectures to be more on the boring side and repetitive (although it is better to air on the repetitive side ya know). Highlight of the class for me was the discussions. I was lucky to have Aditi as my TA, and my section actually had really insightful discussions. The course consists of 2ish reading assignments per week, and most of the grade is the midterm (35% of grade) and the final (40%). The two tests are 60 multiple choice Qs and 2 short answer. The wording of the multiple choice questions on the tests reminded me of a standardized test – it tries to be misleading, so I wasn't a fan."
Akhil Gupta,NA,Anthropology of Food,ANTHRO 133,A-,"Overall, I really enjoyed the material presented in the class. Everything you discuss is relevant to your everyday life. The workload is intense. We were often doing 400-600 pages of reading a week, which is tough when you have other classes to worry about. You are required to read 4.5 books + weekly articles. Reading is mandatory and lectures are based on your readings. The course isn't necessarily difficult if you keep up with your readings, attend lectures (they're podcasted), and understand the underlying themes of the course. Often times he repeats the themes of the readings, movies, and lectures. If you put in the work, you'll do fine. The grading scale is in your favor. I believe it was 40% receive A and A-, 40% receive B+ and B-, and 20% other. There are weekly assignments due in discussion. You also have to complete 2 projects, which are relatively easy. The Midterm and Final rely heavily on your understanding of concepts/themes and ability to connect readings/themes."
Akhil Gupta,NA,Anthropology of Food,ANTHRO 133,N/A,"First of all, I wouldn't recommend this class unless you have no choice. It is true that you go to lecture and do your readings, then you do well. BUT think of this class is a 4-unit class, but it is way much more stuff, even more than some of the 5-unit classes. You have hundreds of readings to do every week, weekly assignment due on discussion section, two additional assignments (a diet diary and a 1800-word project), AND you have a midterm and final which are not easy at all. His lectures are basically just that he read off his notes/written essays about his review on those readings in a fast, quiet tone. He had nothing on his slides except a few pictures. There isn't any so-called ""lectures."" All this class is about readings, if you don't read, you can't understand in lecture and you screw up. BUT the readings' workload are huge and they are hard, not easy to understand at all! He requires you to finish reading before every class, but these readings are about like food and Marx theory (WTH?!). I would say give some introduction about the big picture before letting us read will be more effective. It seems like he thinks all students only have this class. SO, if you only think this class as a 4-unit class and enroll it with other major classes, you gotta be careful. ALSO, he has so many requirements. He didn't allow you to argue your grade unless its a calculating error. A lot of ""you can't do..."" and he takes picture of the scene of every student taking exam in case of cheating, which is a little bit over. He tells us in the last class, ""I can tell you right now the final will be a difficult 3-hour exam."" I really feel he's intending to MAKE students work hard."
Akhil Gupta,NA,Ethnomathematics and Anthropology of Numeration,ANTHRO 133S,N/A," Grade: A I took Anthro 133F (Anthropology of Food) with Gupta and all I can say is wow. Hands down one of the best, most interesting classes I have ever taken at UCLA. Gupta is a kind, well articulated professor who loves what he does and has a great deal of knowledge about it. If you're looking for that easy A, this may or may not be your class. All you need to get a good grade is go to lecture (or listen to the podcast) and read the readings/view the films. He incorporates the readings and movies (which are actually good movies) into class lectures effectively. This class forever changed my conception and understanding of food/culture in a very positive way. Most importantly, he is not monotone and his lectures are actually interesting. I highly recommend taking this class to anyone who values learning something that isn't just going to be an easy A, but might actually teach you something that is useful and entertaining."
Akhil Gupta,NA,Visual Anthropology: Documentary Photography,ANTHRO 135,N/A," Do not take Gupta if possible. He cares so little about teaching or students. He told us he would not respond to questions via email.  The only grades are the midterm and the final, and the class is curved. This may sound good to a lot of people, but in reality the questions were deliberately designed to trick you - with choices such as ""A, B, C, A & B, A & C"". The questions were often framed in an unclear manner, but you are not allowed to ask clarifying questions. He is a completely ineffective teacher and does not implement any student - focuses teaching methods."
Akhil Gupta,NA,Development Anthropology,ANTHRO 147,A,"Akhil Gupta's Development Anthropology class was hands down one of the most interesting classes I took in college. His lectures and reading material helped me contextualize international development in a way no other class at UCLA was able to do. Though the multiple choice questions on his tests are worded a little funky, I think if you read the material, you will be able to do well in this class. The curve is also in your favor."
Akhil Gupta,NA,Selected Topics in Social Anthropology,ANTHRO 149,N/A," I took Anthropology of Food when he first offered it. I enjoyed the class as he gave better than average lectures for an Anthropology professor and one that comes from an engineering background. He also integrated movies to further validated his points which gave a break to the traditional classroom What I didn't like was his avoidance to deal with grades. He has a policy that I respect where you don't question final grades. But I didn't like how he handled the final. He left during the Finals Week, and had proctors. I had 95% going into the final, but ended up with a B, because the proctors did nothing when people were texting answers on their phones obviously. This totally screwed the curve, even though he gives 50% A's and 40% B's,  It was really bogus. I should have gotten an A"
Akhil Gupta,NA,Selected Topics in Social Anthropology,ANTHRO 149,N/A," I've had two classes with Gupta [Anthro of Food and Developmental Anthro] and I have to say I absolutely love him! His classes are easy. He curves all the grades, giving almost half the class As and most of the rest Bs, you have to have not gone to class at all to fail his classes. Anthro of FoodThe readings aren't very necessary, he tells you what you need from the readings in class. For studying you just need to review your lecture notes.  As for the post about his test questions saying ""according to Prof. Gupta . . . "" thats because he tests off his lectures.  The tests were mostly multiple choice with a few short answers.  I thought this class was very interesting, it started off boring but he eventually moves into current day things: fast food,corruption, etc. We even watched Supersize Me.  My only complaint is that he focused a lot on India and Japan and not too many other places. Developmental AnthroThis was the first time he taught this class it was interesting but not really my thing.  The readings were more necessary because there is a discussion with participation grade. The tests were very slightly harder because the TAs made up some of the questions.  It was interesting but there was a lot of theory at the end, and he gets some of his info [mostly stats] from wikipedia. Overall he's a really good professor and pretty easy classes.  People tend to be afraid to take him because he doesn't do regrades.  But the tests are multiple choice with 2 or 3 shorts answers that are usually regurgitating a list or definition.  Just watch out for the ""none of the above"" on the tests he loves those."
Akhil Gupta,NA,Selected Topics in Social Anthropology,ANTHRO 149,N/A,"I had Gupta for the Anthropology of Food. I regret taking this class. I thought it was going to be a fun, interesting class, but it turned out to be boring and pointless. I ended up with a decent grade, so this isn't a rant because I didn't get the grade I wanted. His lectures were boring at best, he repeated himself a lot, and talked either about very broad concepts or very minute details, with no regard to connecting them. The material was unorganized, as he would assign readings for one day, and not talk about it until the next week, we would never finish movies in order, it would be half of one here, half of another one there. He doesn't take ANY regrade requests. So if your scantron is messed up, you're screwed. He was originally an engineer, and now teaches anthropology. Your entire grade depends on 40 multiple choice questions, and two short answer questions spread over two tests. Also, the final is cumulative, which wouldn't be an issue if the material built upon itself. Instead, it was a waste of time to go back to look over old material that was only loosely connected to the current readings. Also, half of the test questions started of as ""according to prof. Gupta..."" or ""prof. Gupta mentioned in class..."" so it's not about know the material as much as it is knowing his opinion on the readings and movies.   "
Akhil Gupta,NA,Selected Topics in Social Anthropology,ANTHRO 149,N/A,"Anthropology of Food was an interesting subject matter, and Professor Gupta incorporated popular movies and books into the class material.  I enjoyed his lectures, and he presented the information clearly while highlighting the important material.  He stressed key concepts in lectures and on the exams.  There was a midterm and final with the midterm weighted at 40% of your grade and the final at 60%.  The midterm consisted of 20 multiple choice questions and the final of 22 multiple choice questions and two short answers.  If you go to class and pay attention, both tests will be easy.  He grades the class on a curve, as well - giving around 30 to 40% of the class A's.  Take this class!  His accent makes lectures a little difficult to understand, but I would still recommend this class."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"Duranti makes himself available if you're ever confused on anything but I never did any reading for this class. I took it as a GE, and to be honest I got an A+ but I feel like I havent learned anything. I had Jarred as my TA and he's an awesome dude, and could be  very clear but nobody in my discussion section actually did any work for this class. If you want to learn dont take this class, but if you dont mind writing and you think you're a decent writer, take this class and its an easy A."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A,"Anthro 4 was an ok experience for me. My main issue with the class was the format of assignments Professor Duranti chose. The basic structure was 6 assignments with no release/due dates to just be given out at various points in the quarter - each was worth 20%, lowest one gets dropped. If you are happy with your grade after five, you don't have to do the sixth (or you can choose to not do one of the other assignments). No midterm, not final, literally nothing matters in this class besides your grades on these assignments (discussion sections are optional, no participation or anything). In theory, this is actually awesome, and it had its benefits, but unfortunately in the first 7 weeks of the class we had two (2) assignments... you get where this is headed. Even though the assignments themselves are really not difficult and Duranti directs you to the corresponding readings and gives some hints, the pacing of the workload was really not distributed equally. Maybe not a killer for everyone, but I found this to be pretty frustrating. My TA (Spencer) was great, he clearly really wanted to engage us and was super helpful if you went to optional discussion sections, but I thought he was a bit of a harsh grader on some things. For me, the reason this class was a ""so-so"" experience was that I found the subject (linguistic anthropology) to be really dense, hard to understand with the effort I was willing to put in (honestly, took this as a requirement, just wanted to get it done with limited interest in actual topic going into the class), and more reading than I was hoping to have (especially at the start, near 100 pages per week). Duranti however is clearly passionate, invested in our learning, witty, funny, and ALWAYS offering help and answering questions. I think the class lost some of its charm being online, but overall was a fine experience and not too difficult grade-wise to succeed."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"If you attend lecture, do the readings, and show up in section an A+ is achievable. Professor Duranti is very passionate about linguistic anthropology, and it is evident in his teaching. Sometimes he would have music playing (or play music himself) while people were signing into zoom for the first minute or two of class. It set a nice tone to the class! The way he structures this class prepares you well for taking Anthro-M150 if you are on the anthropology path. I feel like previous reviews from people who say they learned nothing were likely not paying attention in class. You will get out of the course what you put in."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+," Note: Taken Remotely on Zoom Structure:There are 6 assignments and only 5 are counted for your final grade, with the lowest grade dropped. Discussion sections are not required. Pros:The lowest assignment grade is dropped, meaning if you did well in the first 5 assignment, you did not have to do the final one.  My TA was Sara Castro-Font, and she was very kind and clear during section and responded to emails in a timely manner.  She made discussion worth attending to understand the assignments better. Professor Duranti gives out A+'s in this class. Although the class schedule said this class was synchronous and online, Professor Duranti records the lectures, and as a student with responsibilities outside of school, it was a nice surprise for the remainder of the quarter. For a large lower-division class, Professor Duranti is very accessible in office hours, and he has a lot of insight on the field if you are fascinated with the subject matter. As confusing as it was, I found that the subject matter was overall really interesting, especially the readings about communication in death penalty court cases. We covered topics like objectivity versus subjectivity, agency, and linguistic relativity. Professor Duranti was also very empathetic to us and canceled class during the coup. Cons:My section was on Monday, and they were often filled with bouts of awkward silence because no one had done the readings by then.  I found myself lost during lecture because the material is inherently difficult and abstract. It was difficult sometimes to stay awake or show up. The first assignment was given out a few weeks after Week 1, which stressed many students out. Afterwards, they were given out on Fridays before the weekend. Although this was done to make it fair for students who did not have their discussion sections until the end of the week, it was a hassle to complete these on the weekend. Verdict: I took this class as a transfer student and Communication major to complete my lower-division linguistics requirement. I would recommend it if you do not mind an unorthodox class structure and are a solid writer. Also, take this class if you are interested in the field of linguistic anthropology because Professor Duranti is very knowledgeable in the subject, and he is actually very accessible and really cares about your learning."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"Professor Duranti was an engaging lecturer and often adds personal anecdotes about his own research to entertain the class. His lectures are recorded if you can't attend the live sessions, but going over his slides for each week suffice for the assignments given. You don't have to buy the reader since he's very considerate posts the weekly readings of the course's required text on CCLE. I highly recommend you do skim the assigned articles and readings to at least have some knowledge in order to answer the short-essay prompts he assigns. Some students pass without doing the readings at all, but that depends on which T.A. you get, since some have more strict criteria than others. I had Alessandra as my T.A. and she was super sweet, organized, and explained the course material really well. Overall, this class was interesting, flexible, and had a light workload. Totally recommend it!"
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A,"Despite the raving reviews of Duranti, mines is going to differ. Compared to the other social science courses I have taken at UCLA, this class was by far the most disorganized which made it hard to learn. Although the material seemed engaging, the lectures were hard to understand and felt more like trying to decipher information. It didn’t help that my TAs discussion was lackluster to the point that only around 5 people would show up each week. Sure this class was an easy grade, but also it just felt like a waste of time. I would not recommend taking Duranti and rather choose a different GE where you will actually learn and are engaged in the class."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A,"Professor Duranti, Was an amazing professor he really cares about all of his students and generally wants them to succeed. The workload is fair and the grading is all dependent on how much work you do."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A," Duranti is a true homie. He is a bit disorganized (and he knows it too and jokes about it which I respect), but at the end of the day, he makes a point. I had Nicco as my TA and he was great. Every week we had thought-provoking discussions that I found my self discussing with classmates after as well. I'm pre-med so I thought I would just take this class as a GE and be done with it, but I was truly interested in the subject of linguistic anthropology.  As for the class, you've heard it already, there's no midterm, final, or paper. Rather there are 8 pop-tests throughout the quarter that are mainly based on the readings. They weren't too hard and your lowest one gets dropped and replaced with your highest score (which should be a 10).  Anyways, if you take this class PLEASE take it with Duranti."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+," FAVORITE CLASS TAKEN YET!!! Professor Duranti is a great lecturer and is super helpful and open to talking about his own research and stuff. The books we read are really great! It is sort of a lot of reading for this class but honestly you can skate by without reading the articles thoroughly but I would recommend reading the books thoroughly. There are pop quizzes that you can't make up so you have to go to lecture but you get to drop your lowest one. They are like once a week. The questions on the quiz are detailed based on lectures and readings but most are true/false  and then like 1 short answer question.  The reason I say to read the books is because he normally gives 2 options for the free response: one super easy one from the book, or something extraordinarily picky thing that only a savant would remember. Take for example, ""What was different in Franz Boas' grammatical description of Kwakiutl as compared with Bertonio's grammar of Aymara?"" versus like an easy thing about the book. The quizzes are merely to make sure you're keeping up. That being said, they make up 80% of your grade and the other is 20% attendance/participation in section.  This class is great because what Duranti cares about is that you learn something and it makes you reflect on the world and about life as opposed to having to memorize verbatim who said what in 1981. I would 100% take a class from him again.  Was not the biggest fan of my TA, Hannah. I felt bad because it was 9am and was not in the mood to discuss linguistic anthropology and neither was anyone else in section. So that was more on us not being prepared, than her. Of course this was frustrating to her so I can't blame her. On the other hand, she is very approachable and nice in office hours or if you have a question in general.  TLDR; take this class!!!"
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A,"Beware that this class is taught in an unorthodox way. Duranti, who is a very accomplished academic, has decided on a method of teaching the class that involves the following:- Your knowledge of what he says in lecture is not graded, but he tells you to take notes on his words because the slides he has will be uploaded for your viewing at any time. (Don't fall for his trap; you won't be graded on what he says. But he will tell stories and generally amusing tales, on top of added anthropological information, in case you want notes on that.)- You will read 3 books over the duration of the course, and several other articles. You also have to know the content of the slides (note: SLIDES, which are uploaded, NOT what he says while showing them in lecture) as if they are readings.- You will be graded almost entirely (80%) on the 8 pop tests he gives. This is the only practical reason to come to lecture.- The tests evaluate your knowledge of the aforementioned readings; usually you have to recall details and themes from the texts, which can be tricky. Occasionally you will get an open-ended reflection question.- The last 20% of your grade is half attendance and half participation, both only for your discussion. Definitely go, because if not, you're probably boned, and they will actually probably be fun (unless you really hate the books).- Duranti admitted that at least one of the books he assigned he had not read before the course begun. (Granted, it had come out the previous year--I'm talking about A Death In The Rainforest by Don Kulick--but we read it in three weeks, and he could have read it sooner if he wanted to.) This tells me the class is pretty much improvised as the quarter goes on. This also means that some of the details in my description here could change before the next time he teaches this class. He has an improvisational attitude in general, included in his taste of music: jazz jamming."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+," Basically it was a super easy A+, but you'd have to sit through 2 pretty boring lectures every week (lectures aren't podcasted).  There were no traditional final and midterm but instead pop exams that were given every so often (8 in total). The books that were the required reading (I highly suggest you read all of them as they are vital to you answering the test questions) were pretty interesting, A Death in the Rainforest by Don Kulick (loved it!), Confronting the Death Penalty by Robin Conley (interesting read, a little repetitive) and The Everyday Language of White Racism by Jane Hill (lol, took a lot of effort to get through this one).  The tests were like 5 true/false questions and 2 open-ended questions and worth 10 points in total for each test. I had Reem as my TA and she was super helpful in relaying the material because I literally do not pay attention for shit in lecture so going to my section was highly necessary in my case.  Honestly, take the class for the grade but other than that I wouldn't say Durantis lectures were super engaging so he often times lost me when we were like 10 minutes in lecture. His slides are often very short and don't carry much context so can't rely on that too."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"Professor Duranti is truly a unique lecturer. He always gives anecdotes and tries to engage our large class. Sure, he goes off tangent, and he is aware of that, but don't worry too much about taking notes in lecture. Some lectures may seem long and a bit dry. He will post the slides later, so you can refer back to those. I didn't expect this class to be so focused on linguistics. Nonetheless, the books he assigned to us were not too bad, and I actually enjoyed one of them. The pop quizzes are pretty easy. Just have an idea of what the last week's readings and lectures were about and you'll be fine! He even drops your lowest quiz grade. The fact that there are no final and midterm makes this one of my favorite, low-stress GEs. Duranti cares about his students' wellbeing and understands that a GE should not cause an unnecessary amount of stress, which I found to be the case in some of the other GEs I have taken at UCLA. I would recommend this class. You will definitely learn something interesting out of it."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"This class was weird. The content is relatively dry and the workload is alright. You are assigned 3 books to read throughout the quarter. Pretty easy reads. Lecture entails Duranti using slides that correlate the reading to his other lecture material, all super boring tbh. However, Duranti is a very interesting man. He is super accomplished and honestly really funny. He is a realist and understands the lives of students and how much they have to do. There is no final or midterm in this class. It consists of 8 pop tests that are assigned throughout the quarter. People say this is random but honestly you can figure out the pattern of when you'll get one really easily, and sometimes he even emailed us the night before and told us we would have a test the next day. These tests were super easy, if you skimmed the reading which I did for the first book (didnt even read the second 2) and listened moderately in lecture while jotting the slides down, you'll be totally fine. Also these tests were super bs-able and you could pull answers out of your ass left and right. My TA was Max B. , he was super nice and graded very easily. He is a very formal and intelligent guy and uses a high level of language during discussion, sometimes tough to follow, but at the end of the day I was glad to have him as he was a forgiving grader. My advice if you are thinking of taking this class, do it. It is super finessable and honestly not too insanely boring, Minimal effort will give you an A if you know how to finesse a class."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+, Sweetest man ever!!! Very easy A! He often goes off topic and is sometimes hard to understand but he is a very nice professor and really cares about his students. He posts the slides after every lecture and had pop quizzes (8 in total) instead of midterms and final. They were very easy but ensured that you did your reading/went to lecture. They were true and false and short answer questions. Each quiz was about a page long and varied from 3-6 questions.

Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A,"Love professor Duranti! He is a little old man from Italy and super funny. It's not always clear what he's saying but it's an easy A so doesn't really matter. There's no midterm or final; just pop quizzes based off the weekly reading assignments. Very light workload, no attendance in lecture but ya never know when there's gonna be a pop quiz. TA takes class a little too seriously but I def recommend this for GE."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A,"I would recommend this class as it is a fairly easy GE. Professor Duranti does get fairly off topic sometimes regarding his studies, but it is interesting seeing how accomplished he is. There are no midterms and finals, only pop quizzes and tests. Although the only significant difference between the quizzes and tests is one or two more questions. These pop quizzes/tests also make it hard to skip class because you never know when they're coming. Other than that, this class is nice to get a GE out of the way."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A,"This class was definitely an easy A. No final, no midterms, no papers. Just pop quizzes or tests every week, so you couldn't really skip lecture bc you never knew which day the test or quiz was on. If you have a good TA and discussions before the quiz, you'll be fine. My TA Wesley was the absolute best and always told us what was going to be on the test/quiz. Professor Duranti is a sweet man, but not organized at all. The material of this class is very dry and super boring, but if you have a good TA (especially Wesley), you'll be fine. I only read the first book (you're supposed to read 3) and I ended up with an A. Selling all 3 books 818-239-9844"
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A,"Duranti goes off topic all the time and likes to talk about himself and his studies a lot. Even though this class is very easy with very easy ""tests"" and ""quizzes"" -basically the same thing - with just 3-8 questions and no midterms and finals, you need to do the readings. Very easy GE and a fun professor, and my TA was very good in summarizing his ideas. I recommend this course by him but I do not recommend taking a harder Upper Divison course from him."

Duranti is a great guy, but the class can be a little boring at times and he goes off topic quite a lot."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A," Duranti is a very distinguished professor, but he is not a very good educator. He doesn't ever seem to come in with a plan for his lecture, and very quickly goes off on semi-related tangents that are mostly about his own work and observations. That would be fine if his pop quizzes didn't concern the lecture material. Most of the time, I was at a complete loss as to what I needed to absorb and what was just Duranti giving us his unchecked thoughts of the world. I'm very thankful that my T.A. during the quarter was such a big advocate for the students, and was a better educator than Duranti himself."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"Professor Duranti is one of my favorite professors. He teaches in a way where you actually learn the material instead of just memorizing it and forgetting it. Showing up to discussion is extremely important because that is where you will go over the readings. You don't necessarily have to read every book he assigns, just read the important parts that are relevant to lecture. There are no midterms or finals. Pop quizzes and tests only, which are usually one or two questions each. Overall, this class is interesting and fairly easy because you learn the material and retain it, so you don't have to study that much."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A-,"Tests are extremely detailed questions on books, so you actually have to read, but I read all the books and got As on all the tests, which count for 50% of the grade.

Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"Professors Duranti is basically a genius, however his teaching skills are a bit average. His accent can make things a bit confusing at times and he likes the make jokes, which bothers those students that like flow and structure within their courses. However he passes out review sheets before exams which helps A LOT and is basically the entirety of the exams. My TA was TERRIBLE (I can't remember her name, but she was short with short brown hair), she basically just read off the book during the entire lecture. Overall, the class is pretty fulfilling and you learn a lot."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"I love this guy! it's sad to see people bash him so bad, but i enjoyed his class. He is really into what he teaches, and his stories were entertaining and necessary for the course. There were 3 assignments, a midterm, final, and random pop quizzes during the quarter. If you have read the material, and at least carry a general understanding of the material you can get an A. I also attribute this to the TAs willingness to fill in where the professor might not have completely covered a topic. Duranti is not so bad!"
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"i couldnt get myself to go to the lectures (too random, no structure... eeeeasy to get all ADD), and my t.a. was a nightmare.  the assignments werent clearly outlined, so the grades really came down to your t.a.'s style.  theres a lot of reading for this class that last throughout the entire course, and i found it really easy to fall behind if you like to read for detail, opposed to just skimming and not really understanding.  section didnt help me out at all, so i wasnt a big fan of the class."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"duranti has a rep for being unstructured and quirky. he's pretty weird to me, but i've never met a ""normal"" linguistic person. the class was alright, my TA was cool. answer all the questions on the study guide and you'll do fine. the projects are a bit weird and tedious, but it had to be done. i wouldn't take it if i wasnt' an anthro major. i feel like only people interested in linguistics and jazz will love this class. it can't be that bad if there were so many athletes in the class."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"He's a nice guy and very famous researcher, but I found his class and the readings, dull, simplistic, and self-important rather than educational. Make sure to get a good TA and at least skim the readings. I would recommend strongly against taking his class, but you almost must if you're an athropology major (unless you go to summer school)."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"i loved professor duranti. he's funny and charming and a really engaging public speaker. this class was not easy. i got an a+, but i worked my butt off. do the readings, which range from unbelievably interesting to unbelievably not-interesting, ask lots of questions in section (get a good TA - ask around, it really matters), do your projects and you'll be fine. i really like an organized class, where i can clearly follow the arc of the class and see how everything connects, and i didn't get that from lecture, but i got it from section, so it was fine. it really did open my eyes to the details of communication, and some of the readings remain some of the most interesting articles i can recall reading. plus, again, professor duranti is just a bad-ass."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"Duranti is honestly the most inspiring professor I've experienced here at UCLA. He's extremely witty and funny, and quite brilliant, all of which is reflected in his lectures. He speaks at least five languages, and incorporates much of his own (very interesting) research of language and travel into the lectures, instead of the drab words and research of another anthropologist. The projects aren't too hard or time consuming, and if you either go to lecture or do the interesting readings in the Reader that he wrote, you'll do fine on the midterm and final. He really cares and wants the students to understand the main concepts, but he doesn't make the student memorize nonsenical facts. I still remember everything that I have learned from Anthro 33, and have become so much more interested in Linguistic Anthropology since. Thanks Duranti!"
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"I really liked Professor Duranti! He was very excited to teach and had a lot of enthusiasm during every lecture. He encouraged his students to visit him during office hours or whenever we were in Haines just to say hi. This class is also extremely easy. The discussion sections are mandatory, but that's okay since the TAs (my TA at least) are great and she explained things very thoroughly, especially the readings. I ended up with an A- in the class and i didn't even read two of the books! My TA and Duranti explained the material well enough that I didn't need to (that, plus i didn't buy the books). If you need this class for communications or just as a GE, I suggest taking Anthro 33 with Duranti. Also, as another person mentioned, don't leave lecture early!"
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"Duranti's class was very easy. Despite the large reading load (which you can just skim over for the most part), it was very easy to get an A in this class . There are 3 projects that are actually kind of interesting and a midterm and final (which are almost identical in format and length). When I took it, he had weekly in-lecutre quizzes but canceled them later because athletes kept having to leave. Duranti is an incredibly nice guy with an adorable sense of humor and genuine concern for students. He hates it when people leave his lectures so if you take any of his classes, try not to! =)"
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"He's a nice guy, decent prof...but rambles a lot.  If you want an easy GE with little reading, HE'S NOT THE PROF TO TAKE because there's A LOT OF READING!!!  He's fair, but boring in lecture sometimes.  hf, gl."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A," He's nice and funny, but he is horrible at teaching. I mean reaaaaally bad.  Only take this class if you HAVE to."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"I thoroughly enjoyed Duranti, not only for the jazz or cultural music he played in class, or amusing videos he showed, but for being such a passionate and enthusiastic man. He enjoys getting emails from students (so much that he reads them in class) and he likes when people participate. There are pop quizzes in class that are fairly easy if you keep up with the reading. Basically, do the reading and everything is all good. Plus, many of the articles are interesting to read. There's a group project which entails going to this whack museum, but the overall the experience was entertaining and better than writing a paper. I highly recommend this class, and yeah you have to work a bit to get an A, but I'd rather learn something new to get that A than wasting my life away in some no brainer G.E."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"While his lectures were a bit on the unorganized side, it wasn't impossible to follow.  Most of the readings were decent except for the Constructing Panic book which you will learn to dread.  The tests were very fair and the assignments weren't hard.  Just go to lecture, take notes, pay attention and read.  I'm a comm major and some of these concepts actually appeared in other classes...overlap is always a good thing.  I wouldn't say this is a fun class by any means, but it's not horrible."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,I have never heard anything good about any Anthro class so I was very hesitant to sign up for this one. And I thought it was a great class! The lectures were interesting in many aspects. The readings from his book were also interesting but I hated the Finnegan and the Agoraphobia book. If you know all the questions from his study guide you will get an A on the exams. The quizzes are easy - just look over your notes from the previous lecture before class. The assignments were a lot of work. I never spent so much time studying or writing for a class but I found the assignments pretty straight forward. He loves it if you come to his office hours!!
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"I really enjoyed this class. While Duranti is a bit hard to understand at times, he is very passionate about what he is teaching. At the end of the quarter, he took a whole hour just to tell his story and his heart for teaching and this subject. I found the topics covered in this class very interesting. I took it my first quarter at UCLA, and found it to be generally easy. You just have to do the readings and study the review sheet and it's fairly easy to get an A. Over a year after taking the course, I have retained much of the information and, as a comm major, I have found it very useful. I don't completely understand the awfully negative reviews- It is an interesting class, a nice professor and pretty easy class- you just have to do the reading and study."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"The one and only anthro class I took at UCLA. He made us by a bunch of his books, and his class was so boring I fell asleep often. I never fall asleep in class. Oh, I had a terrible TA, who, like the professor, was incredibly arrogant, distant and rude. A waste of time, and of your parents' money"
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"Overall, Duranti was a pretty good teacher.  Although his lectures were a bit disorganized and he oftentimes went off on tangents, he still presented fascinating information and made you think about the world as a huge web of communication.  I found most of the readings to be pretty interesting as well.  He tries to ""spice up"" his lectures with handouts, but we hardly ever got through them.  His thoughts seem convoluted and you may not think that lecture is worth going to, but you do walk away with some knowledge; his lectures somehow work their way into your head.  And of course, he does have 3 in-class quizzes that you do not want to miss out on, so I would recommend attending class regularly.The book report and the other short-papers/hw assignments were not too difficult, especially if you met with your TAs.  The TAs are pretty open and caring, and do not grade too hard.  The exams were also not too difficult, especially since he gives you a review sheet and the TAs hold review sessions.  But you do have to do the readings.Basically, both the TAs AND the professor just want you to learn and be able to apply what you learned to the real world.  "
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A," Prof. Duranti is the only reason I questioned my transferring to UCLA.  He is a boring lecturer who mumbles and makes a class so hard and uninteresting that everytime you attend you want to slit your wrists before it's over.   The tests all rely on the readings so to get a good grade you just have to read the book and attend every 3 lectures because most likely he'll give a pop quiz then that can help improve your grade.  If I were you I would not take it but if you MUST (and make sure you MUST) then drink up or something before you go into class.  I got a good grade, but frankly, I just wanted to learn.   P.S.  Any interest I had for anthropolgy prior to this class have completely dissipated.  But you'll learn alot about his wife."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"Professor Duranti was a tad boring during lectures, but everything you needed to know was in the reading. The reading was extremely straightforward and easy to anticipate what type of questions would be on the exams. Basically, if he went over something in class and it was matched in the reading, you'd be tested on it. I managed a B+ with little effort. One 5-7 page book report (150-200 page book) and a very short group project.  Overall, pretty easy GE. Take it, Duranti's a good professor and entertaining with his jokes and accent."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"Reasons not to take this class: Duranti is a passive-aggressive narcissist who cannot keep his own thoughts straight, much less communicate them to others. He is obsessed with whether or not all 250 people in class are listening and watching. He can spot someone not paying attention to him or nodding off in the back of the auditorium. He spends way too much time trying to embarrass these people than he does teaching. He seems to have no concept of anything other than himself and his own (self) interest. He frets a lot over whether or not  people can see him, hear him, belive him, etc., etc., etc. His classes are mind-numbingly boring, as is the dumbing-down power point and handouts he relies on to teach his class. His only other obsession seems to be his wife's work of which you will learn a lot. His readings are baised, ridiculously outdated, his wife's and closed to non-UCLA personnel. He is just a very bad teacher.Reasons to take this class: You never have to go to lecture and can get an 'A' easily. TA's try very hard to teach in discussion and are available to students (mine was terrific). Duranti's tests are almost entirely based on readings which you can do on your own. Hs tests are easy, although they are ridiculously long. If you do go to lecture, you can catch up on other work, do crossword puzzles, take a nap or read the works in the reader. Pay attention to the tone of these reviews. I did not and this was truly the worst class and worst teacher I have ever had. This was written by an anthro major, ""A' student who got an 'A' in this class and was initially excited to take this class. I had considered specializing in linguistics. I dread having to ever take another class in this subject."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"This class has some of the most challenging readings, but I guess thats what you'd expect from a five unit class, right? I thought Prof. Duranti was a moderately challeging teacher to understand because he improvises a lot during lecture, but the main points of his lectures are pretty clear because he hands out outlines before each lecture. In this sense, he kinda leads you to make the connections to the readings and his lectures yourself (he'll never make them completely explicit especially before an exam), which is cool when you finally figure them out. Also, there is no answer key for his open ended study questions which leaves you with answers that are too short or too long, but at least you are going in the right direction. The exams are fairly long and thorough, but having written longer answers for the study questions helps prepare (or overprepare) for this. In all, I thought Duranti was an excellent professor. I recommend him for two reasons, the material tells you so much about the world around us, and because you pick up so many useful methods in extracting data from texts, recordings, etc. in this class. Duranti stresses from the beginning that he is going to treat everyone like future scholars, and after taking his class, I definetely feel more confident that I can connect what I read and write to my research interests. By the way, if you are given the option to read his book for the book report, do it! It is the best way to understand the concepts in the class."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"quit ragging on sandro, y'all!  this class was indeed hard as hell for me, but only because i didn't have one of the better ta's.  the assignments were actually pretty fun.  i got out and did stuff i never would have done if it weren't for sandro.  my eyes were opened to many new cultural experiences.  i also loved his last lecture, which makes me a little teary-eyed just thinking about it.  and also the muni bird story.  anyway, if you take this class, do all of the assigned readings (that's what 95% of the tests are based upon) and make sure you get a good ta."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"Ok, you guys...who said a GE class is supposed to be easy?  Is that why good money is being spent for you to attend UCLA--to breeze through classes?  You should be ashamed of yourselves!  I really enjoyed Anthro 33--Duranti is an expert in his field.  Lectures were informative, and I'll admit I hate group projects but they DID teach me how to work as a team towards a goal.  Tests were totally fair--and if you pay attention and do the reading you'll do just fine. A good class and important if you wish to discover the diversity of human experience.  Definitely not boring--and if a little reading scares you why are you in college? Go serve burgers and fries :0)"
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"Professor Duranti is a really great guy.  I went to see him in his office hours a couple times and he always made sure to ask me about how the class was going and even my other classes.  It is true that the readings are the most important part of the class.  Most of the tests are based off of them.  Contrary to what other posts say, the reading load is not that much compared to a normal social science class.  I thought the tests and projects weren't too hard.  I did really well on them, but that may have just been my TA.  Overall though, this is a great class and a great professor."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"I took this class about 2 years ago.  I was reading through people's comments and thought I had to submit a review because Professor Duranti is getting a worse reputation than he deserves.  I found his class to be pretty enjoyable.  While I did think some of his assignments were a waste of time, they were pretty easy.  There is a lot of reading (which you must do in order to get an A in the class), but over all it is not that boring or difficult.  The exams (which are composed mostly of short essay questions-approximately a page for each one) do make you feel a bit pressed for time but if you have done your reading you should do just fine.  Discussions aren't very helpful but they are required since you earn points for attendance.  If you end up with a good TA, consider yourself very lucky because the TAs are the ones that do the grading.  Also, Professor Duranti does spend a lot of time talking about his own (and his wife's) field work.  This does get a bit annoying sometimes, but over all it's actually very interesting to see what goes on in a culture that seems so different from our own.  You really must wait until the end of the course to really appreciate what you are being taught and exposed to.  It all comes together at the end, but you need to keep an open mind and be ready to take in everything the course has to offer."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"I enjoyed Duranti's class. I have to admit that the lectures were sometimes boring and the reading was overwhelming at times, but I felt that the material was interesting (if you're into social science kinda stuff). I also thought that Duranti was really concerned about all his students. How many teachers in a lower div intro class ask students to fill out evaluations of them after every class and e-mails the class on an almost weekly basis? He also changed our third assignment in order to suit all the students' needs. None of my other professors did that. But I think this class has more to do with the TAs because they grade everything and some of them are more pickier than others. I think as long as you get the basic concepts and go to the TA reviews, then it's easy to get a passing grade in the midterm and finals. Overall I enjoyed his class and I would recommend him to other people."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"First, professor Duranti is really into what he teaches.  In the first few classes, you really are excited about the class lectures.  Then, as you realize that you have way too much reading to do, and that the reading is sometimes impossible to get through because the articles chosen to teach topics in the class use vocabulary and ""understood"" ideas that only liguistic anthropologists themselves, or interested students taking upper division courses in the subject area would understand.  The assignments are really easy if you have good writing skills.  Be careful on the midterm, you have SO little time for the amount requried of you.  Also, don't bother buying the book ""Key Terms""--he tries to squeeze it in, but it really doesn't fit any of the material all that well.  He isn't even using it on our final."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"I had low interest in linguistic anthropology coming into the course, and I have an even lower interest now. It's just soooooo boring. Sections were boring too. Sometimes you just sit there in lecture and listen to music for the whole time and ""analyze it in an anthropological point of view."" Ugggh. Duranti himself is an okay guy. His assignments are vague so you don't really know what he expects from you, until you get it back and realize he expected something completely opposite of what you did. Sometimes you'll get lucky and actually do well. His midterm was crazy-some of the questions come from nowhere. You have about one hour to answer 5 essay questions, some matching and true-false parts, and whatever else he chooses to add. It is very stressful and rushed. And might I add that there is a lot of reading. There are sometimes around 80 pages of really boring reading for one lecture. I didn't enjoy this class but I got a B in it so it's all right. I wouldn't recommend it, but I won't discourage it. If it interests you go for it, if not, steer clear."
Alessandro Duranti,NA,Culture of Jazz Aesthetics,ANTHRO M158,N/A,"Duranti is a nice guy, but it is VERY hard to understand him.  Nothing in this class was consistent.  The material was very repetitive and when asked to evaluate on it, there was not much to go off of.  Nothing was expanded on in class. Everything went on side tangents.  TA never knew had to grade anything right and when asked for a re-evaluation nothing would get done about it.  Speaking of the grading system, it was terribly set up and your grade  is based off 60 percent online quizzes and 40 percent final paper.  FInal paper does not get explained in class and you will most likely get an F if you can't read their mind.  I dont recommend taking this class because to end up with a bad grade in a class that should be fun and inspiring is very disappointing. "
Begona Echeverria,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A," I took Anthro 33 Spring Quarter 2001. Character She talks sooooooooooooo fast. She can probably digress, tell an anecdote, make 50 remarks before she stops to breath. Okay so I'm exaggerating. Prof Echeverria has a lot of energy, and wants everyone to sit as close as possible to the front. She makes the effort to memorize names and she does get it right half the time. She's not a comedian, but she's high on adrenaline, and that's enough to brighten your day (in theory). Lecture style Before each lecture she has handouts for everyone (most of the time). It is basically an outline of critical concepts and ideas from the readings you have done the night before. She places EXTREME emphasis on having the material read because she wants many people to participate in class (a la raising your hand), and it's pretty hard to understand what's going on without reading the book (although you can still pick up a few things via handout). She encourages participation, even if you're wrong, she doesn't care, and you shouldn't have to worry; she won't pick on you. The only time she picks on you is if you've dozed off in class and sit conveniently in her field of vision like I did. Reading Oh why! The course reader is thicker than my math book. *frown* And several of the readings are so verbose, particular one I forever shall remember: the horrorendously long-winded article by Jacqueline Urla. Prof Echeverria will do this to you. Exams She passes out review study guides before each exam, and you'll like this because the midterms and final questions come directly from the review.  You're given a set of questions in which you get to decided which one to answer (not too shabby). Of course, they are the essay questions, and usually asks you to describe an anthropological concept backed up by several readings of different authors. *moans* You have one midterm and one final. The midterm covers the material from the first half of the quarter, and the final covers material from the second half, splitting readings you have to study (which is absurdly a lot anyway). Projects She assigns two group projects (that you can choose to do by yourself, although she doesn't condone it). They do require a lot of effort given the problem of having to find the perfect day to work on the project when everyone is free. So, be sure to keep the groups small. The assignment requirement isn't that much (a 5 page essay usually, double-spaced, single-side), but my group usually went overkill anyway. Grade Your grade is based on one midterm (15%), one final (25%), two projects (20% & 25%), participation (5%), and in-class writing assignments (10%)."
Begona Echeverria,NA,Selected Topics in Linguistic Anthropology,ANTHRO 159,N/A,"Begona is great!  I enjoyed her exuberance and humor.  There is no droning lecture stuff going on here. Some of the readings are a little long-winded and obscure, but they DO reflect the kind of material you should expect in this type of class.  DO be prepared to speak up in class--participation is important.  The group project thing I never like in ANY class, as you have to rely on strangers to get the work done, or do it all yourself--but besides that, the class was cool.  She may not be at UCLA much longer, so if you get the chance, definitely take one of her classes."
Robert Boyd,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Great prof. Interesting material (especially if you're like me... somewhat interested in science, but not quite interested enough to be a South Campus major). Fairly generous with grades. I would recommend him. :)"
Robert Boyd,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Prof. Boyd is a good prof. His class was not difficult at all. The lectures are definitely not the most exciting, but all the material covered during lecture is definitely fair game to what his tests consist of. His midterm and final were definitely not hard. His curve is extrememly fair. "
Robert Boyd,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Since the lectures were presented in a slideshow format in a big, dark room, it was difficult not to sleep during class. I don't think I was awake entirely for ANY of his lectures. However, he does present and discuss important material on his slides, but if you have a good TA (my TA was beyond excellent: she emphasized all of the important concepts that were eventually tested) and review the slides and know the concepts, you will do just fine. His exams were short answer response-type questions on the important concepts. He may throw in a very specific question since he did so on one exam which threw me completely off-guard but missing just that one didn't hurt my grade. Immersing yourself in the material (Lecture, reading, slides, discussion) will get you a good grade; the grading is quite straightforward. A very fair and reasonable professor."
Robert Boyd,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"All i got to say is lecture was boring and i basically learned everything without attending lecture and by reading the book, but attending lecture after the midterm is important because that is when things are a little more complex.  I did not find the TA i had effective at all i just attended discussion because of attendence and homework.  Tests are essay questions...its not an easy GE class, but not a very hard one either, but he really curves the grade so that is one of the good thing"
Robert Boyd,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"I disagree with the review below me. Professor Boyd is a fantastic lecturer that really engages students with the material. He got me interested in Anthropology and I regretted the few lectures that I did miss. I also had the bad TA, Lulu, but just talking out the concepts in discussion helps reinforce your learning. I didn't think the homework load was too much. I mean, if you want to do well on the tests, you must do the homework since it's the same type of stuff covered on the midterm and final. All in all, I thought it was a great class. Easy A for me."
Robert Boyd,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,i basically learned by the book since lectures are boring and it is basically outlining the book.  It is important to go to lectures after the midterm because the readings get kind of difficult since there is a lot to memorize.  I didn't really go but i still passed with a B only because the class is curved for my benefit.  the tests are a little hard and this course carries a lot of reading.  it is like you are basically on your own since my TA lulu isnt very helpful in preparing us.  i only attended discussion because i need the 10% freebee cause you will need it considering that hw is very time consuming and it is only worth one point and showing up to lecture is worth three points and participating is worth one point so basically all that effort is worth so little considering that it takes a lot of time to do hw
Robert Boyd,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A," The book for this course is his own, so the lectures are pretty much just the main points from each chapter. Consequently, you really only have to go to lecture or read the book so long as you really do one of them. Missing lectures in the beginning is no big deal, but in the second half of the course it can get you behind. The second half is all about the human lineage and recognizing fossils and such, so it gets a little boring, but it's also a lot more memorization then the first part.  Overall, this class is cake as long as you read the book and/or go to lecture. Discussions were useless, but were required as 10% of your grade. Final's half, midterm's the rest. Both tests are all short answer questions, nothing really surprising. Overall a very fair professor and very easy class. Great GE. Take Anthro 7 with Boyd if you can."
Robert Boyd,NA,Models of Cultural Evolution,ANTHRO 186P,N/A," Really boring class, not by way of subject material, but by way of everything is related to each other so everything is kind of the same so the topic gets confusing. It's funny considering he wrote the book, at least you would expect the author to give clear explanations Grading in this class was two exams 20 questions each. He has a nice curve where he gave 40 A's 40 B's,  But should have taken advantage when the fire alarm went off during the final, because that pushed my grade way down as everyone started collaborating, this was after 1/3 had left so this could affected you too without you knowing I don't know how he dealt with that but I certainly got pushed off to the lower end of the grading scale for not choosing to collaborate"
Robert Boyd,NA,Models of Cultural Evolution,ANTHRO 186P,N/A,"He is a really cool guy. He wrote the book required for the class, so the lectures pretty much mirror the reading. The grade is based on a midterm and a final, which are both on an extreme curve. Overall, the class was interesting and he made the lectures entertaining and worth showing up for."
Robert Boyd,NA,Models of Cultural Evolution,ANTHRO 186P,N/A," Professor Boyd is one of the most amazing professor that I have ever had. He is incredibly intelligent and brilliant in the cultural evolution subject. This course urges you to see culture as a selection like natural and sexual selection. He argues cultural selection plays a huge role in human evolution and he pushes you to think beyond the basic understanding about mankind's evolution. Don't be fooled though, he still knows the current gossip on celebrities.  As for his classes, there were 1 midterm and 1 final with a mixture of M/C questions and short answers. He changed it up a bit from last time he taught 186P. His tests are rigorous but he gives a very generous curve (final avg is A-/B+).  Sadly, he is leaving UCLA to lead a newly formed department at ASU. I really wish he would teach one more undergraduate course before I graduate in Spring."
Robert Boyd,NA,Models of Cultural Evolution,ANTHRO 186P,N/A,Easy and interesting. Two simple multiple choice test. Book is not required and is pretty much word for word of his lectures which are bruincasted. Most generous curve I have ever seen at my time at UCLA. Curves the class to an A- or B+. I don't know why other people are bitching. 
Robert Boyd,NA,Models of Cultural Evolution,ANTHRO 186P,N/A,"Okay first off the comments below are pretty harsh with the SC Cheerleader remark! Lol Boyd's lecture's weren't the most invigorating (Not a lecturer like Prof. Fessler), but his class was interesting. If you attend lectures/ watch podcast, and complete his study guides, it's an easy A! If you use the book then your definitely going to pass his class. Simple 30 q & a mutiple choice midterm and final. I wish I could have him every quarter so I could graduate with a 4.0! It's an easy course and he's actual pretty cool and more then willing to help (if you don't annoy him)"
Robert Boyd,NA,Models of Cultural Evolution,ANTHRO 186P,N/A," This class blows more than a USC cheerleader. I was actually looking forward to taking this class, but it was so dull. A lot of the models Professor Boyd gave us were absolutely unrelated to Anthropology & his point. Apparently this class is ""controversial"", but it makes perfect sense: culture evolves & it evolves faster than our genes. It would seem that he's anti-psychology (+10 points for you, Boyd!), but the information given was a bit of a hot mess (-10 points). A lot of his examples are based on psychological studies of groups & his disapproval of such conclusions from these studies is subtle. Dr. Temperance Brennan's disapproval of psychology = spews from her pores. Boyd's disapproval = subtle. He doesn't force his opinions down your throat. He presents each study & discusses the ""scientists'"" conclusions to which he will make comments about how there are multiple ways of interpreting such data &/or he will let you figure it out for yourself.  There was a guy who constantly heckled Boyd & I'm under the assumption that he's a psychology major. Don't get your panties all up in a bunch because psychology is 80% BS. Alas, I digress. Onto more important things. In the beginning of each powerpoint are bullet points of what he will discuss, but so many of the examples involve kayaks, celebrities, oars, rudders, & a watch that the point of the lecture gets lost in that beautiful picture of David Beckham. If he stuck with anthropological studies & concepts to support his argument, this class would've been more interesting. Let's face it, as an Anthropology major would you rather learn about the evolution of sundials or evidence of natural selection amongst a group of primates &/or a population of people?  His class is curved like no other class I've ever had before. It is AMAZING. My raw score on the midterm was a D like around 70% of the class so I ended up getting an A after the curve. Either everyone in that class is just as disinterested & confused as I was, or they just decided not to show up for class since he has podcasts.  His multiple choice tests are horrendous. Most of the questions are just an entire chunk of a paragraph with 4 answer choices half as long as the question. His study guides are helpful, however it would benefit you to study the concepts pertaining the answers (get really in-depth with each answer to cover all topics just in case) than just studying the study guide at point blank.  Class is based on a midterm & final grade. No homework, no papers, some reading. I tried to read the book & even take down notes from the book, but everything he assigns you to read is condensed on his powerpoints.  Random note: Boyd is kind of attractive for a man who could very well be my grandfather, but I hated his class so much that it was difficult to like him. "
Robert Boyd,NA,Models of Cultural Evolution,ANTHRO 186P,N/A," The curve for this class was horrible. I don't know what the other reviews are talking about, but when I took the class I remember that 10% got As, 20% got Bs, and 40% Cs, and the rest C-s and Ds.  And on another idea thing, is that even if when he gives you the midterm questions beforehand, he doesn't give it early enough. And when he does give it he gave 35 questions for both the midterm and final and these were long questions that were extremely designed specifically so the class grader could cut points everywhere so you can fail. I would look for another anthro class to fulfill this requirement. I like the 150 series better."
Robert Boyd,NA,Models of Cultural Evolution,ANTHRO 186P,N/A,"As an anthro BS major, this class is what dreams are made of. The material is mind blowing. Unlike the rest of the anthro department who can't tell you what DNA stands for, Boyd incorporates his knowledge of the biological sciences into his take on culture. It's fascinating, fun, and a must take. And if you don't get an A in the class, you are a lazy person. He gives a list of all the possible midterm and final questions before the exam, so that you know everything that will be on the test. It's a slam dunk! My last and favorite anthro class. "
Robert Boyd,NA,Models of Cultural Evolution,ANTHRO 186P,N/A,"Professor Boyd is awesome. He makes you think! The class is really fair, and his book is awesome, it's not hard to read at all and all the information you need is in it. He posts his lectures online so you can just follow along in class. His lecture gets confusing but if you do the reading you'll have no trouble. Awesome class, if you get a chance make sure to take him"
Mariko Tamanoi,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A," Professor Tamanoi is very sweet and tries her best to help out her students. Like someone mentioned before she does have an accent. Her accent is thin but her grammar is somewhat bothersome. You will still be able to understand her points but she does have grammar mistakes in power points and when she lectures. Her lectures and required readings are somewhat interesting. You should go to all her lectures. She talks a lot about the readings and the main ideas she wants you to get from them during her lectures. Although she puts her power point slides online, it doesn't fully explain her points thoroughly like she does in lecture. One thing that really bothered me in her class however was how she kept talking about the Japanese culture when we were supposed to learn about ""societies around the world."" I understand that she is Japanese but I wished she had focused less on Japanese culture and diversified her class more.  Tamanoi is very strict about discussion sections. You are only allowed to miss one discussion without it affecting your grade. My discussion section was with Bradley Cardozo and he was very helpful and nice (a tough grader but he goes through all the points that Tamanoi wants us to know for the final). The discussion sections are very important since that's where you can get more information about the main ideas Tamanoi wants you to get from the readings. The TAs are also the ones grading your work so it's a good idea to get their main ideas too. PARTICIPATE in your discussion sections! My TA marked down people who participated and gave them points for it. There was no midterm for this class but there were 2 essays and a final. The essays are very doable and easy. I did both of my essays on the night before they were due and still got A's on both. That being said, don't do the same thing because I didn't get any sleep on those nights. The first essay topic was to describe my culture and the second essay topic was for me to interview someone else about their culture and write an essay on the interview. The final was very difficult to study for. She had about 50 multiple choice questions and 2 two part short answer questions. Since it was very broad, this was hard to study for; I didn't know what to focus on for the final. When you study for this final make sure you go over the main ideas in lecture, in the films she shows in lecture, the power point slides, and the main ideas & authors of the readings. Basically review everything that she taught in class. I also found some random quizlet flashcards online that somewhat helped me so you guys could also try and look up her class on quizlet.  Overall, this class easy but you have to put in the effort. I got an A- in this course but if I did the readings, then I am sure that I would have gotten an A. Do the assigned readings and go to lecture if you want an A!"
Mariko Tamanoi,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A," DO NOT TAKE HER.  Unfortunately I did not listen to the other reviews and decided to try taking her class. It was the first time she taught Anthro 9. She SUCKED. She was so disorganized, had a very strong accent, focused on Japan, didn't care about her students, and just rambled. Lectures were stupid and my TA was even worse. She spoke MINIMAL english. I got A-s on both the papers and a B+ on the final, somehow I got a B in the class. I have never had a teacher who needed to email the entire class about them requesting grade changes HA. I spoke with many students in her class who said they got lower grades than what they deserved. She is ridiculous and is an AWFUL teacher if you want a good grade or if you want to learn. "
Mariko Tamanoi,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A," I wish I had listened to the other reviews on here warning me that Professor Tamanoi was a horribly disorganized professor and poor lecturer and not to take her class. Hopefully you will be turned away! I admit, I fell victim to the syllabus too because I thought taking a class with two papers was better than a midterm. However, our first paper wasn't due til week 6 (which the prompt, I might add, made no sense that even the TA's were confused), so by that time, after the harsh grades were revealed, it was way too late to drop the class without any fees or change your grade to pass/no pass. There are infinite reasons why I regret taking Professor Tamanoi's class but to sum it up, here are some cons that really irked me:- She is not concerned with student learning. She provides a study guide for the final but refuses to answer any questions you may have concerning the study guide, and even goes to the extent of telling her TA's they are not allowed to answer questions either.- Her lecture slides do not make sense. Her grammar not being on point only makes matters worse. i.e. ""Why care their culture?""- She once told the class, ""I got this information off Wikipedia, so if you miss anything I say, just google it and you should find it on the Wikipedia link."" This goes to show how much effort she puts into her lectures. The sad  thing is, Wikipedia breaks down the material better than Professor Tamanoi does.- She assigns readings to the class that she says ""are dry, but just suffer through it."" I do not understand why a professor would assign readings even she does not enjoy...- She may come off having a sweet personality but she is pure evil! She constructed a final exam with questions she admitted were confusing to herself even but still proceeded to make us take it. The final exam alone dropped my A average in the class to a B-. Overall, do not take this class unless you want to suffer with major confusion of the material, frustration from the lack of professor feedback, and see a plummet in your GPA."
Mariko Tamanoi,NA,Study of Culture,ANTHRO 130,N/A," I don't really recommend this class to anybody.  I have never received anything lower than an A- during my time at UCLA (over 7 quarters). However, I somehow received a B+ in this class. Based on the syllabus, this class seems fascinating and great. However, it really is not.  Professor Tamanoi is not a great lecturer. She reads from the powerpoint and can be fairly funny- both are fine. However, the meat of the course is her just presenting her arguments on things. They somewhat connect to the hefty amount of readings that are assigned. This class does not really teach students to think critically and to analyze, because they aren't really given the tools or practice to do that.  This class does have section. I had a terrible TA experience. If Misa Dayson is one of the TA's, do NOT take her. She is unreliable- she missed 4 sections because she missed her bus. Therefore, we all showed up to our 9 am Friday section, only to sit there until somebody from the Anthro dept came to tell us that Misa wouldn't be coming to section. Additionally, she was never at office hours, and when she was, she was never on time. Misa never answers her e-mail either. Finally, when we did have section, it was less than great. She is not a great communicator, and doesn't do a great job of synthesizing what we learn in class with the readings- an unfortunate reality seeing as how Professor Tamanoi mainly uses lecture to present her own arguments about various topics.  Your grade in the class is based on section participation, a midterm, project, and take home final.  The project is alright. You're supposed to find one article a week that relates to the general themes of the class and analyze it. However, this can be problematic. Sometimes, I would find an article and analyze/ critique it, only to find out that we would later cover issues more directly related to the article in say 8th week. Apparently, we were then supposed to rewrite our critique? The whole point of the project seemed to eat a lot of time (especially since I did one article a week) and failed to really help us. I would have rather had to write just a paper.  The final was alright. We basically had to write a 6 page (max) paper that was a research proposal- it had to include a lot of elements we talked about in class. However, whenever I went to get feedback during office hours, I felt like I left more confused than focused. It seemed like neither Professor Tamanoi nor Misa could really explain what they wanted, and weren't really able to help me.  In the end, this class seems fairly disorganized. There is a lack of unity and connection between lecture, reading, section, and the assignments/ exams. I don't recommend this class. I did not really enjoy it, and I am frankly quite shocked and confused by the grade that I ""earned."" "
Mariko Tamanoi,NA,Study of Culture,ANTHRO 130,N/A," This class is not what you sign up to take.  The schedule of classes says: ""Twentieth-century elaboration and development of concept of culture. Examination of five major paradigms: etc. ""  What you are actually taking is a class on the anthropology of children, and Tamanoi's idea of something she calls ""the cultural.""  This bothered me a lot, because while it was interesting for a minute, I did not sign up to take a full quarter on this random subject that Prof. Tamanoi arbitrarily decided to pursue. I was also very frustrated when the ""take-home final"" turned out to be a 6 page paper consisting of a theoretical anthropological research project proposal, for which we received no in-class preparation. On the opposite end of the spectrum, we were also assigned a final project, and the examples from past years that my TA gave us looked like they came from an elementary school.  One was printed up on lined binder paper, and another on stationery that had children holding hands on the borders.  REALLY?  In an upper division class?? But don't make the mistake of procrastinating on it.  As brainless as the project is, it is VERY time consuming. Prof. Tamanoi is a nice person, and well-meaning but I found this class on the whole to be uninspiring.  Her lectures were dull and her thought processes are half-baked at best.  When I pointed out a self-contradiction in her power point, she couldn't understand until one of the TAs spoke up to support me.  And even then she glossed over the contradiction.  Again, she is a very sweet woman, but I was unable to respect her as a professor and had little use for this class, despite the fact that it's my major."
Mariko Tamanoi,NA,Study of Culture,ANTHRO 130,N/A,"Professor Tamanoi is really concerned about her students understanding the material. Her lectures are a tad bit dry, reading straight off power points, but she's a kind and funny woman. Her main concern is that students learn something new, and stresses that. Midterm wasn't that bad- final project was easy. She's pretty chill and understanding of students."
Mariko Tamanoi,NA,Study of Culture,ANTHRO 130,N/A,"oright, here was the breakdown. there is a midterm, easy project, and final. the midterm, just memorize the study guide and you'll get an A. the project was BS. you find 7 articles and write one free essay on each. and the final which is a 5 pg paper. there is absolutely no point in going to classother than finding out when exams are and stuff. She repeats powerpoint presentations word for word. every morning i would fall asleep within 20 min of class. Coffee doesnt even work. She is hella boring. I ultimately got a B in the class by pulling an all nighter for the midterm, straight up BS on the projects, and i wrote the final paper in a day. Also, it would be a good idea to get the midterms from the previous quarters cuz a couple questions are the same. Anyways, good luck."
Mariko Tamanoi,NA,Study of Culture,ANTHRO 130,N/A," All right, she's an okay teacher. I absolutely do NOT recommend her to ANYONE. Lectures are word for word her slides, the readings aren't all that interesting (and rather useless for the class as a whole), and her midterm exam was ESCRCIATING! The midterm was filled with vague ""critique this passage as an anthropologist"" questions... seems easy right? Imagine my surprise when my coherent, cogent, well thought out critique of Margaret Mead and was met with 7 points taken off with NO comments! OH! If you take this class do whatever you can to NOT have Camila as your TA. She is absolutely TERRIBLE! Not only was she useless (she wouldn't answer questions if we didn't participate), she also LAUGHED AT US when we DID ask questions! I would leave every discussion feeling like a child who had just been sent to time out. She was no help at all!"
Mariko Tamanoi,NA,Study of Culture,ANTHRO 130,N/A," Really, the woman is sweet. She\355s always emailing about new lecture slides being posted online and about how far along she is in grading things. She really tries to keep you on top of things.  Aside from that, the class is pretty easy. The lectures are a little dull and she seems to repeat herself a lot, but all the lecture slides get posted online. She gave us a pretty thorough study guide for the midterm and the TA\355s and her explained it during sections and lecture. The readings aren\355t too heavy and there aren\355t that many of them. For the final we had to write a proposal for an anthropological study which didn\355t really seem related to what we\355d been studying all quarter but it wasn\355t too difficult.  She seems to be a pretty easy grader and she\355s really approachable. However, she does have this tendency to schedule her classes really early in the morning, but I\355d recommend her."
Mariko Tamanoi,NA,Seminar: Psychocultural Studies,ANTHRO 135C,N/A," I don't recommend this class to anybody!  The syllabus is misleading because you think you are signing up for a really interesting class but it's not. Also the way the class material is presented, you think you are learning about current situations but most of it is outdated. Professor Tamanoi is not a great lecturer. She is however the sweetest lady ever. I absolutely adore the professor but her class and T.A Misa Dayson is disappointing.   This class does not teach students to think critically and to analyze, because they aren't really given the tools or practice to do that.  This class does have section. I had a terrible TA experience. If Misa Dayson is one of the TA's, do NOT take her! She is horrible. She grades ridiculously and yet is never around. She went out of town during the quarter, was sick, and missed class. She is unreliable- she missed 4 sections because she missed her bus. Misa never answers her e-mail either. She also discloses on the first day of discussion that if you are unhappy with your grade, do not bug her over summer. I dismissed this comment thinking that the students that complained previously probably didn't do their work. But now I totally understand! Misa also docked me several points that did not make sense on my midterm and I had to go to the professor to have her re-grade it.  The project is so easy but they grade difficult. It is ridiculous. It is your opinion on the articles yet they will grade you, on your opinion..... .  During office hours, It seemed like neither Professor Tamanoi nor Misa could really explain what they wanted, and weren't really able to help me.  In the end, this class is disorganized. There is a lack of unity and connection between lecture, reading, section, and the assignments/ exams. I don't recommend this class. I did not enjoy it Sadly because of the budget cuts, this class will probably remain. Maybe the professor will get the hint that she is here for her students and if she is going to set up specific expectations, address them more clearly and do not use T.A's who are hard on their students but are never around or available"
Mariko Tamanoi,NA,Women's Voices: Their Critique of Anthropology of Japan,ANTHRO M145T,N/A," Professor Tamanoi is fantastic! I would not recommend this course if you are not interested in gender studies though. The guys were actually very comfortable in the class it seemed, and participated when possible.Personally, from the view point of having had almost no knowledge of Japanese culture, I feel this class was a gem. If you have questions about differences in ""Asian"" countries this is a great place to begin. I think many people are ashamed at how ignorant they are about this region of the world, but Professor Tamanoi answered our questions with patience. Also, the tests are straight forward and she gave a study sheet, not much else you could ask for. "
Mariko Tamanoi,NA,Japan,ANTHRO 163R,N/A,"     Like the others say, extremely nice lady, mediocre lecturer.  The readings are rather dry, but on the plus side I didnt read any of them and got an A anyway, so the grading scale is pretty easy.  If you're into Japan, she does cover some interesting stuff, so I'd recommend her on the whole, but dont expect edge of your seat excitement.  Oh, also she will say the phrase ""And so on and so forth"" literally 7-8 times per class. Just so you know."
Mariko Tamanoi,NA,Variable Topics Research Seminars: Anthropology,ANTHRO 191,N/A," this class is AMAZING! it was a small seminar class, about 17 students, and each week the class was taught by US! the class was about college campus life and it was really fun. we talked about dorms, romance, facebook, suicide, etc. the book we had to read was interesting (about a prof who pretended to be a student lived in the dorms).  since it was a small intimate setting, we all knew each other pretty well by the end and it's pretty easy if you go to class and do your projects.  TAKE IT."
Olga G Solomon,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A," A very enjoyable class. Her lecture style is not the most enthalling or interesting, but she herself is a very interesting person. You can really tell her dedication to her research and how much she cares about the autistic children she works with through the stories she would tell in class. It is just too bad that most of the time she reads off of the handouts she gives out at each lecture. There are 2 projects and 2 tests, all of which are pretty easy. The readings were enjoyable and really presented a lot of iteresting issues pertaining to Linguistic Anthro and really opened my eyes to a lot of issues out there. Just read up on all the material and go over the handouts she gives you and the class is an easy A."
Olga G Solomon,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"As an anthro major this class was disappointing. There was no structure to the class--every lecture we move on to different topics that seem to have no connection to the previous material. The required readings were absolutely painful: long, wordy, and vague. And the 2 projects are just a waste of time. I think the biggest problem I had, though, was the TAs. My TA (Eleanor) was just plain useless. Overall this class is bearable, but if you have other options for a social and historical analysis GE, don't take this class."
Olga G Solomon,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"Not a good lecturer.  Our classtime consisted of her handing out a handout (which ended up online) and then reading said handout to us.  She showed approximately two movies, neither of which was on the midterm, and most of our grade is coming from two ""projects"" that she thinks are fun but really could be considered a nuisance.  One said project was to sit for an hour, 3 different weeks and observe; i'll admit, actually pretty cool to people watch.  But then we had to write a 10 page paper about something we'd observe.  I never have too much trouble writing papers, and I couldn't figure out anything to write.  We also had a lot of reading, which you sometimes you never ended up having to read because she puts the whole plot down in her handout.  Basically if you want a class where you don't have to go to class and you only have 2 test and 2 papers, this class is for you."
Richard Lesure,NA,Theory in Anthropological Archaeology,ANTHRO 111,A,"Professor Lesure is the best! He is approachable, clear in what he wants, organized, and all around delightful! This subject and class is pretty dense with a lot of required readings, but as someone who is not an Anthro major, they were actually pretty interesting. I was kind of lost in the first 3 weeks of class, because I've never taken a class like this, but Professor Lesure made it very enjoyable. He interacts with students and is very open to opinions about everything! The class grade mainly consists of 3 papers, and while that might seem formidable, he is SO clear about what he wants in them in the class right before he assigns the prompt. I did record every lecture on my phone because the slides aren't too helpful and that was a good move because he mainly lectures about the really important stuff. I actually liked this class a lot, and I'm betting it's because Professor Lesure was teaching it!"
Richard Lesure,NA,Theory in Anthropological Archaeology,ANTHRO 111,B,"Let me start off by saying Professor Lesure has a great presence as a lecturer.  He has a witty sense of humor and is always very engaging.  With that being said the subject matter for this class is a bit dull.  The title of the class says it all, it’s a class about the history of archaeological thinking which can be boring but I’ve found that there has been a lot of overlap from other upper div anthro classes.  This class is definitely doable if you attend lecture and comprehend the readings.  Grading for this class consists of 3 main components: participation/attendance, quizzes, and essays.  He does not take role everyday but usually does when it is labeled as a discussion class, which there are about 6 of during the quarter.  The quizzes are on ccle and pertain to grammar and proper citations, not the readings.  Those are extremely easy.  For the three essays he gives you about a 72 hour window to read the two prompts, choose one, and then write a 5 page paper.  While his grading can be a bit harsh, he dedicates the class before he post the prompts to having a discussion about the readings where he basically tells you what to write in the paper.  He holds office hours as well which are very useful to understand what exactly he is looking for.  Overall, Professor Lesure is an entertaining lecturer and this class is definitely doable if you stay on top of the material and complete the assignments accordingly."
Richard Lesure,NA,Theory in Anthropological Archaeology,ANTHRO 111,D,VERY HARD GRADER. Unrealistic expectations for students. Reading load is HEAVY. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS if you are looking for an easy or enjoyable course.
Richard Lesure,NA,Theory in Anthropological Archaeology,ANTHRO 111,N/A," Great Professor, plain & simple. Has a great sense of humor during class and truly loves the material he is teaching. His lectures are straight forward and provide a great background to the material you read, as well as expand on the material and connect it to present day times.  The exams (essentially 3 midterms) are 1 short answer and 1 essay that are usually based on the readings, but ask you to incorporate lecture material into them for a full, complete answer. The readings can be a little bit boring at times, but the overall topics are quite fascinating. Absolutely do all the readings and go to every class, he does a random sign up sheet that accounts for 10% of your grade. Oh, and make sure you meet with him outside of class, that dude knows so much on this stuff that he can't possibly convey it solely during lecture (really helps get you that A on the tests)."
Richard Lesure,NA,Ancient Civilizations of Mesoamerica,ANTHRO 114P,A,"Some people find Professor Lesure to be dry, but my Anthro crew and I thought he was hilarious! He is passionate about his subject and is an overall engaging professor. You will do fine in the course so long as you attend lectures and do the readings  - they are both essential to the three take-home midterm papers and the take-home final paper that are assigned. You're only given 48 hours to complete the midterms, and 60 hours for the final, but you can prep ahead of time by doing the readings and the weekly (non-mandatory, but really helpful) reading questions."
Richard Lesure,NA,Ancient Civilizations of Mesoamerica,ANTHRO 114P,N/A," Really great professor, very funny. The material is interesting if you get into it. If you commit to the readings (which are a huge part of the course), then you'll do fine. Pay attention in lecture. He posts lecture slides, but they only say one or two words; he supplements the rest in lecture. It can be kind of boring, but I found the best thing to do was to at least skim the readings before class.  But overall, he's just a really nice guy, very approachable in office hours and quite funny."
Richard Lesure,NA,Ancient Civilizations of Mesoamerica,ANTHRO 114P,N/A,"This guy is adorable.  He is sooo enthusiastic about his work and wants you to love it just as much as he does.  He is kind of geeky and will make a lot of funny jokes.  I would recommend his class.  He isn't too difficult, just make sure to do the reading."
Richard Lesure,NA,Ancient Civilizations of Mesoamerica,ANTHRO 114P,N/A,"I love this guy. Really knows his material, enthusiastic, and really really nice. He gives out 1 page papers on the reading to boost your grade. One midterm, one final only. Short questions and one 3 paragraph essay. He's a really lenient grader, there were like 50 B's in a class of 80. Huge curve will catch you, take him if you can."
Richard Lesure,NA,Ancient Civilizations of Mesoamerica,ANTHRO 114P,N/A," HES GREAT! He is super enthusiastic about what he teaches, hes super nerdy but in a totally adorable way. He makes all these funny archaeology jokes. He was such a great professor and showed how much he loved the material, that i am no considering maybe becoming a professor.  He made what had the potential to be a boring class very interesting. He doesnt bs around, he gives you review sheets for the final and midterm, and will basically give you the answer to any question you have on the review sheets. He set aside a whole class to go through our final review sheet, and basically just gave us the answers. Hes super nice and very intelligent. The reading was sort of on the heavy side, but you can totally scan it to do your response papers (which he basically gives you a ton of points just for doing)  If you have to take an arch class for your anthro major, take one with him!"
Richard Lesure,NA,Ancient Civilizations of Mesoamerica,ANTHRO 114P,N/A,"The material is awesome, my favorite archaeology for sure. Lesure's lectures are quite unorganized, and he lectures off the top of his head, not my favorite. I like structure to a class, so this bugged me all quarter. The reading is on the heavy side, but he gives you study questions which allows you to pick out the important info (you can scan in other words!). Both tests were made up of questions that came from the study questions, so NO surprises. Lesure is nerdy which is really cool. He has a great personality, and you'll laugh with him a lot. He loves the Early Formative. The average for the midterm was low 80s. I recommend. "
Richard Lesure,NA,Ancient Civilizations of Mesoamerica,ANTHRO 114P,N/A,"This class requires you do the readings and attend lecture to do well on the exams. I only split the readings with two other students for a few chapters, but we took notes for the chapters and answered all the questions he gives for the readings. The questions he give for the readings are vital for knowing what to focus on when reading. He also gave a review page for both  the midterm and final which were a great help. So attend lecture, take good notes, do all the reading questions or split the questions with other students, and study off the reviews and you'll do very well. He really cares that his students learn and do well in his classes. I wasn't nearly as interested in Mesoamerica as I am now. My final grade: A!"
Richard Lesure,NA,Ancient Civilizations of Mesoamerica,ANTHRO 114P,N/A," if you are not an antro major it can get somewhat boring (Some Archaeology).  grading is based on participation and three out of four (5 pg) papers.  papers are all based on articles from your reader.  the class only requires one reader and the readings are not too long.  Athough his lectures help you to understand the readings, you cannot depend on the lectures for your papers.  overall the class is interesting and not too dificult. if you are looking for a class with out too much stress, this is the class for you.   oh yea, i almost forgot, he also stresses on plagiarism, he sometimes dedicates an entire session to it."
Richard Lesure,NA,Selected Topics in Social Anthropology,ANTHRO 149,N/A," I have to disagree with the reviewers here. I had a great seminar style (15 people max) class with him and was constantly impressed by his knowledge. He has a great sense of humor and keeps things interesting. Although, not an all-time fav, dont be scared away from a great professor."
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,A-,"She is very knowledgeable in her field, and is very accessible outside of class. She is fairly energetic in lecture. Although she does not post slides online, they are very useful. Even if I did all the reading, I still felt like one can succeed in the class without doing much of it just because her lectures are very informative. Take good notes and you'll be fine! Study guide is also very straight forward, a pretty easy class in general."
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,A+," Dr. Morris' lectures are boring but helpful because the points covered are those that are most important and thus should be focused on when writing the papers, studying for the exams, etc. The exams were straight memorization based on a comprehensive study guide that she provides. The number of terms on the study guide may seem overwhelming, but the TAs graded the exams extremely leniently, so don't worry too much.  The only reason one might not get an A in this class is if they don't put in enough time into the papers. Overall, Dr. Morris is super interested in the subject matter and, if you need help, is more than willing to provide it if you reach out. Not too bad of a GE."
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,A+,The class is easy and you should manage by just going through the materials listed in the midterm/final study guide and regularly attending discussion. Not as engaging as Classics 30 with Professor Purves as this professor is quite scattered and often leaves you wondering what the point was by the end of the lecture (due to the many tangents she rambles on)
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,A,"This class isn't too bad if you need to get rid of a GE. There's a lot of readings, but if you have a good TA then they're all pretty easy to understand. I literally only learned valuable information from the readings and in discussion. The lectures are USELESS and really scattered, and she doesn't post them online, which I guess is okay considering they contribute absolutely no information to what you need to know for the midterm/final. Honestly I did well in this class by doing the readings, and then just googling all the facts I needed to know that were listed on the review sheets she gave us before each test."
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,B+,"The exams have a super straightforward study guide, she literally gives you a list of terms that you need to know and you have to answer some simple questions about artwork. You can tell she's really passionate, but sometimes the slides won't make sense and have question marks on the ends. Easy class, would take again."
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,A-,"Professor Morris is extremely knowledgeable  about Ancient Greece and her lectures are always very detailed and easy to follow along. However, each lecture is packed with so much information, it often became pretty tedious and honestly lectures were only worth going to if you're truly interested in the subject material. For midterms and finals, there's a study guide posted and if you stick to studying what's on the sheet, it'll be a breeze. Just try not to cram everything in the night before because the tests cover a lot of material. There is a ridiculous amount of reading required for this class so be careful on not falling too far behind. Try to actually keep up with the deadlines that Professor Morris sets for the readings though, because unless you're really good at BSing, you're going to need to have some idea of what's going on to participate in discussion (which counts for a grade). There were 2 papers due during my quarter and I would recommend having a rough draft for your TA or Professor Morris to read over a few days before the due date. This is especially helpful if you've run out of things to say and you still haven't met the word limit, as my TA gave me a lot of good ideas to finish my essay. Your grade really does depend on which TA you end up with as they grade your papers and participation. All in all, I would not recommend this class if you're looking for an easy GE, but it's a very interesting class if you are genuinely interested in learning about Greek civilization."
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,A," This class is a fairly easy GE but I would recommend taking it ONLY if you're interested in Ancient Greek/Classics simply because it will be ludicrously boring for you. People mention that lectures aren't mandatory, which is absolutely true, although I went to the good majority of them simply because it was interesting to me (the lecture hall was probably 1/4 of the way full after about 3 weeks in).  People are saying that it depends on your TA, which might be true but I was under the impression that each TA graded one portion of the exams and left it to the others so that it would be fair for all students, but then again I never discussed these details with TA's or professor in this class (My other classes used this technique).  It's a lot of readings which are, to me, interesting to learn about but if you despise history and find it dull, I would stay away from this class. Morris is VERY knowledgeable and passionate with her work and her lectures are interesting only if you find it interesting. However, they are not necessary at all as long as you keep up with the readings. She does however summarize the readings in lecture so it can help you with essays if you attend.  They know that this class is majority first year and as a result, the two short 5 page papers are designed to be more of a learning experience to the student. They check more for how well you argue and organize rather than actual content for the most part.  The midterms and final are almost structured exactly the same and is ridiculously easy to study for. They give you all the terminology you need to know before hand, including the essay prompt for the final. Perhaps the most difficult part of the exams are the images she tests you, where you have no clue what the questions may be, but they usually pertain to the location and date of where the object was found. Certain TA's are more nit picky than others that is true, so you must be thorough with all the dates and details, I feel as though I should have gotten an A- because I knew I had incorrect answers but they brush over it if you're close enough.  Overall the class was easy and enjoyable"
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,F,I am selling the camp and fisher textbook for this class for 10 bucks. Text 951-741-5841 if interested.
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,A-," I don't know where to begin with this review. I love Ancient Greek History and love Professor Morris but I was not happy with my TA this quarter. I have friends that have different TA's and if you get lucky, getting an A in this class is pretty much a breeze. However, if you get unlucky like I did, to get an A in a terrible/difficult TA's class requires you to be in like the top 10% of the class. My TA graded very subjectively. For instance, if you were a Classics/Latin major she tended to grade much harsher because she had higher expectations. Her expectations WERE not clear in the beginning of the class. I think the workload is very reasonable . The Midterm and Final are exactly what you would expect (you get a study guide beforehand) so doing well isn't terribly difficult. The hardest part is leniency. My TA took off a bunch of points if you mixed up dates or didn't specify the location of an important place, but overall it's not too difficult if you are good at memorizing. Oh, and one more thing about the midterm/final: train your hands early, because they are going to hurt! You are expected to answer a lot in a short amount of time but if you prepare beforehand it's reasonable. Overall, I would recommend the class to anyone interested in the subject (don't take if you don't have an interest). You will learn a lot and much of it is pretty valuable. However, know that if your TA sucks ahead of time, try and switch discussions or consider dropping. Otherwise your sections will be super awkward and grading can be tough. Good luck y'all!"
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,B+," Lectures are not necessary and not at all necessary to succeed in the class, as all the material found on the midterms and final are pulled from the readings.  Lots of memorization and reading, best to take with a friend to split the reading load as there is a lot of reading, and it is very boring.   Grade solely depends on your TA.  Your grade will be made up of two 5 page papers, a midterm, and a final.  Some TA's grade the exams tougher than others, same goes with the papers.  The midterm is poorly timed as all students struggled to get as much information down as possible before the time expired.  Your success will be just as dependent on how fast you can write as how well you know the material. Overall, would not recommend as a GE unless you are very, very interested in the subject material.  Heavy reading load and boring lectures will have you wishing the quarter would end already."
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A,"Her lectures were very boring. Grading solely depends on on the TA you get. The TAs do all of the grading and A LOT of people were unhappy with their grades. There is a good amount of reading in this class; and you MUST do every bit of it. There is a quiz every week in discussion which directly relates to the readings. There are also EIGHT books you have to purchase for this class. The midterm and final are mainly all writing... pretty hard. There are also two papers which are manageable, but again depends on your TA. Personally, I am not interested in this subject at all so I wish I would have taken another GE instead of this one. I would NOT recommend this class for a GE. "
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A," This class was truly wonderful. The professor was entertaining and informative, and SO knowledgeable! The material was great. I loved going to lecture. My TA was fabulous as well - try to get Claire Collins! The essays depend entirely on your TA of course, but it's not that bad. The professor gives you review handouts of what to study before each exam. It's very straightforward and not hard to do well in the class. I really fell in love with classics during this course. It is classes like this that restore a little of my faith in UCLA :)"
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A,"A very awesome professor that really knows her classics. I took classics 10 winter '10, and had a lot of fun. The professor is always willing to talk to students, and her lectures are entertaining, never too boring."
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A," Key word to the below poster is ""Good TA.""  If you get a harsh grader, you're nothing short of screwed.  Let me explain:  Two papers in the class (horrible prompts by the way), which are ridiculously subjective.  But the way my TA graded the test was also strange:  he put ""OK"" next to the ones I only partially missed, but got enough right to receive full credit.  So hypothetically, if he decided to screw me, my 97s could have turned into 74s. Lecture was horrid and boring, even if you are a classics major.  She puts a giant emphasis on archaeology.  ""This pot had this image.. blahbity blah blahh.""  By the way, that's about 25%-30% of your midterm and final.  She also pulls out 10 random quotes (another 30% of grade) from all the reading which you have to identify by speaker and significance.  That part was pretty easy, but takes way too much preparation. Books were good choices.  Too bad that she puts the reading at a stupidly ridiculous pace.  Example:  She made us read the Oresteia (300 page epic poem) in a week.  The readings are done no justice, as they are primarily discussed in section.  She just babbles about random stuff and sings in Greek for an hour and a half in lecture, so the only chance you get to discuss them is in section.. which is not nearly sufficient time to go through the themes.      That said, final grade:  A"
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A,"I loved having Morris last quarter, and I didn't think lecture was ever boring. She gave us all the resources we needed for the midterm/final, and the essay prompts were reasonable (especially because you aren't required to seek outside sources: again, everything you need is given). If anything, as long as you attend lecture and keep up with the readings, it takes more effort to do badly in this class. And another note: the readings weren't just dull history documents; we read stuff like Lysistrata, a hilarious ancient Greek comedy. I also had a great TA for the class, so that helped a lot. But yeah, overall, I highly recommend Morris (and the class!)"
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A," Her lectures are pretty dull and it is usually pretty hard to get information from them. A lot of her slides propose ideas/questions rather than facts, which might seem like a good idea but is terrible if you are trying to figure out what you need to know for the midterm or the random discussion quizzes.  That being said, the work in the class is pretty fair. The a study guide for the midterm and final are given and it really does cover everything you need to know. The tests are pretty long and you might feel a time-crunch but its all straightforward (what happened? when? who? etc). There were 2 papers and the prompts were not great but if you write a well structured argument you pretty much get a B or better. There is WAYYYY too much reading though. I read it all and it definitely took its toll on me. I know some people didn't read and got away with it, but I did it and am expecting an A.  Overall, its a decent class. A good amount of work and a bit of frustration, but nothing out of the ordinary. If you are looking for an easy GE this might not be the best idea though. It is based heavily on Greek history and Greek literary works. "
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A,"She's boring. If you get Alex the TA, switch! "
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A," Grade in class= A This was a very straightforward class.Lectures provided a lot of information. Grading was very fair. Before the exams she puts up a study guide that has all the terms you need to know and the important slides as well as where the information on them can be found in the book, she also includes reading passages and from which books she highlights in the study guide. Grade on midterms= 98, another 90something, i forget now.. hahaPapers= 93 and 91Final (dont think i got it back i know I got an A) I went to all the lectures, took notes, paid attention, and did all the reading. If you dont do the reading when it is assigned you will likely get low participation in section, which comes directly from the reading. Good amount of reading, so i recommend keeping up with it.  If you dont, look at what is highlighted as necessary on her study guide for the test.THE FINAL is NOT cumulative.I was very grateful for that, because there are so many details about the dates and where pots and other things were located that you needed to know, it would have been difficult. Professor Morris is an archaeologist so she does emphasize archaeology.   I really liked the class.  I loved the readings.  I thought it was fun. "
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A,"She was not a bad professor at all. I had Sherrylyn the hag as my TA though so that was a horrendous hour and a half out of my life. It's like that giant fanny pack on her waist just sucks the personality out of her, and shes a tougher grader than the other TAs. This is a pretty easy class but the readings really boring most of the time, they actually get worse as the quarter progresses. It's really an easy A though unless you don't find Greek history and culture fascinating at all."
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A,"Professor Morris' power point presentations were generally bogged down with unnecessary and oftentimes confusing information.  Her lectures, while guided by these power point presentations did not always follow a logical progression of conveying information.  She seems like one of those professors who is more or less brilliant in her area of expertise, but unfortunately struggles somewhat to transfer this knowledge to others.  She provided study guides that pretty much spell out exactly what will be on the exams, although the midterm felt extremely rushed; prepare yourself for arm cramps.  I did most of the readings and attended all the lectures, and ended up with an A+ in the class.  I took this class as a pre-req for my major; it wasn't terrible, but I'm not sure I would take it if I were only looking for a GE."
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A," The class CLASSICS 10: Discovering the Greeks is relatively simple. The reading is rather easy, and it is the only thing you pretty much need to focus your studies on. Lecture is worthless for the most part. It just overviews topics in your reading, occasionally giving you a decent essay idea and whatnot. Morris apparently loves her subject matter, and she never misses a chance to advertise their program in Greece. She tends to be a bit dry, but it's not a problem if you don't show up to class. The TAs are generally alright. They're just there to make sure you do your reading pretty much. You'll find good ideas for essay topics in discussion. Participation is graded. There are two five-page essays on rather difficult subjects, so some outside reading may be required. The class seems to do well on these overall. Just don't turn in last-minute work. The midterm and final are not cumulative and Morris gives you a review sheet ahead of time that tells you EVERYTHING you need to know on these exams, which is very generous indeed. There are three parts on the midterm: quote explications or identifications, which requires the general knowledge of all of your reading; the memorization of images of art and monuments along with their time period, location, and significance; and definitions of Greek words and famous figures. The final is the same thing except with a choice of one out of three essay topics given to you a week beforehand. All in all, an easy and mildly interesting GE class. Final grade: A-"
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A,materials in lecture have no weight on the midterm or final; not all the readings have to be read; papers are fair; overall a generally easy class if you put in the work
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A,"Professor Morris is a good lecturer who is very enthused about the Greeks. Her lectures are always very well prepared, though some are a bit more boring than others. The two papers are fair, as long as you start early enough. The grades are based entirely on your TA so write a rough draft and have your TA look over it and give you pointers before turning it in. The midterm and final are mainly memorizing pictures, terms, people, and places, but also have some analysis in them (for example, knowing the significance of certain passages of reading and being able to identify them). I really enjoyed this class, though I must say that I have always been interested in ancient history (I'm thinking of minoring in Classical civilization). So, if you're even remotely interested in this topic, take it as your GE. It requires work but you'll get a lot out of it."
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A,"Prof. Morris is a not very effective as a teacher. Her lessons are irrelevant to what you are graded on - two papers and a midterm and final. As long as you do the reading and show up to discussion you'll get at least a B, A's require a bit more dedication to your essays and studying for your midterm. The only learning that goes on is in your discussion, and a great TA really makes the class worth studying. For the midterm and final, Morris hand feeds you what is on it, she gives you a list of art to study and requires that you identify passages that you read. I found that what she taught in lecture maybe reinforced what was required for the exams and papers - but was in no way necessary for success in the class."
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A," Morris is ok.  Her lectures are not the best in the world, but I also don't remember them being painfully boring--I only fell asleep once or twice.  There is a lot of reading, but not all of it is ""mandatory"" and a lot of it is interesting.  Overall, it's a pretty easy class, if you get the right TA.   The midterm and final were easy because she gives you a list of things you need to know beforehand.  She lists out ALL of the slides and vocab that will be on the tests, and even gives you the page numbers of the things you should read again.  Basically, it's just memorization. The papers are not bad either.  The topis are not dry and are straight fwd.  Not too hard--I got As on both of them.  BUT, you should check with your TA first to see what he/she is looking for, because A LOT of people were shocked with their first grade. I'd recommend the class... it's an interesting and easy way to get rid of a GE."
Sarah P Morris,NA,Discovering Greeks,CLASSIC 10,N/A,"I never thought that anyone could make a topic so stimulating so painful. Her class is easy, and the readings are fascinating, but as far as lecture is concerned, it was miserable. I count Dr. Morris' when I'm having trouble getting to sleep."
Sarah P Morris,NA,Ancient City: Greek World,CLASSIC 152A,A," This professor clearly has such a depth of knowledge in every topic she discusses, which is makes for really interesting lectures that bring in a lot of different topics both related to and seemingly not related to classics. That said, because of her years of experience, her lectures aren't the most organized in the world, though she does post slides after the lecture, which are helpful. I think she's really lenient, grading wise. Your grade is two 6-7 page essays (one on material culture, the other politics related, you choose the prompt most interesting to you as long as you do one of each) a take-home final, and an attendance and participation points boost.  I'm pretty sure she doesn't give out anything lower than an A- on principle, because my first essay was pretty crap (and she told me haha) and she still gave me a 90%.  That said, do actually try on the essays, because the more you get into them, the more rewarding they are.  Also, I'd encourage you to participate in class, because it was really easy not to over zoom and I felt bad for just sitting in silence and having her try to fill the void. Good class, interesting professor. Don't freak out about all the readings in the ccle, most of them are optional."
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A," Okay, so Schachner's class is pretty easy, one quiz every other week, and two papers make up 90% of your grade. The other 10% are attendance if you have him in-person, but for online Spring 2020 it was usually just very short assignments on some reading material.  He also drops your lowest quiz and your lowest paper, so I got lucky and got to finish the class by Week 8. (besides a couple participation assignments) The quizzes are usually pretty straightforward, I would just transcribe the shit out of his lectures and if your quizzes aren't open-note, just try to memorize it to the best of your ability. If it is open-note, go ham on the command-F lmao. I'm not a very good writer but I'd say the papers were relatively straightforward, most people I know got an A/A- which was good enough for the class. While the class is somewhat easy, it comes at the price of being quite dry (at least for myself). That may be my fault for not picking a GE that I found interesting and instead one that wouldn't cause me too much stress but I found a lot of the lectures kind of boring. It may have also been because for Spring 2020, all lectures were recorded and there were no live lectures at all, but I found it hard to be interested in the material. Doing work for the class just involved rolling up my sleeves and gritting my teeth through it.  Would recommend if you have a heavy schedule and want to knock out a chill GE though..."
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A,"Class structure is just 5 essays, worst score is dropped"
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A,"For anyone looking to take an easy GE, Anthro 2 with Schachner is the way to go. Lecture attendance was never required, but they were podcasted if you wanted to listen afterwards. Lecture slides were always posted, so you could always go over them on your own. Before each lecture, there was a suggested portion of reading that usually was an article on a posted website, but if you didn't do it, you were never confused in lecture. Grading was five 700-word essays that were all weighted equally that were every other week. You get from Monday morning when the prompt was posted until Wednesday at 11:59. Let's be real, to do well on the essays you just need to go through the posted slides, the answers for the prompts were right on there. While going to lecture and listening to what he said was helpful, you could scrape by without it. Discussions were interesting, and required that you go and say one thing a week and you can get full credit. As a STEM major, this was a dream of a GE and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A-,"Great class! Professor is very passionate about the subject and clearly wants to portray the concepts to students. Essay topics can be hard but are very easy if you refer back to the notes and lectures. Also, grammar was super important in the exams and graders were super lenient if you went slightly over the word count. PLUS, Prof. Schachner was very understanding about the TA strike and the consequences it had on all parties. Overall, amazing and very engaging class."
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A+,"I would recommend Anthro-2 by Prof. Schachner to anyone who is looking to fulfil the Historical Analysis GE without adding too much workload. There are no mid-terms and finals. Only 700 words long essays due once in two weeks. 4 best essays out of 5 are considered for the final grade. The professor truly cares about his students and is very, very passionate about what he delivers in lectures. Sections in this class are quite engaging too. I do not regret taking this class at all."
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A,"Took this while still in online format. Course consisted of 5 exams throughout the quarter, one of which you could drop. Your best four exams were worth 80% and just going to section was 20%. Exams were 2 page short essays that you had three days to complete. Solid GE. Lectures were not very engaging but material was interesting at points. Recommend 100% Schachner a G"
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A,"The lectures were 100% remote this quarter, and were posted asynchronously. He broke them up into shorter videos, which was very helpful. The lectures can be a bit monotonous at times, and I lost interest in the material towards the end, but overall this class is an easy GE. There are five ""quizzes,"" which are 700 word essays which you have a couple of days to complete. He drops the lowest score, so you can skip on altogether if you want to. I was able to finish the class 2 weeks early because of this, as the final was just the fifth quiz. I found the discussions to be very interesting. I definitely recommend taking this if you're looking for an easy GE with a light workload, it was about half as much work as my other classes."
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A, This class was still online for me Fall 2021 with in-person discussions and a few virtual discussions. I was in the virtual discussion.  The class was easy enough. 5 shorts papers with the lowest grade being dropped along with discussion attendance making up your grade. I would definitely take the class again if I could.  Only downside was that the professor did not have the best mic quality and I often felt like someone was screaming in my ear when watching lectures.
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A," TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Schachner was amazing. You can just tell from the way he talks how much respect he has for others and is just an incredible person. Why you should trust my review? I'm from south campus and took this just wanting the easy A. It was an easy A but also was very interesting and kinda makes me want to minor in archaeology now.   Grading: An essay every other week based on the previous two weeks material. Roughly 700 words each and he drops the worst one aka if you do well you only have to do 4 short essays out of the 5. Also participation in discussion is mandatory but my TA (Eden Franz) always had an engaging discussion filled with extra tidbits which was interesting and helped with the essays. Basically just 4 essays and show up. This class covers the dawn of humanity up until the conquistadors disrupted American civilizations and focused on how material culture and sites explain human behavior. I always associated archaeology with Indiana Jones as in find some cool shiny stuff and put it in a museum but this class really focused on the humans behind the objects. My mind was absolutely blown with how cool the past actually is. We watched how stone tools were made (called flint knapping!) which changed my perspective from dumb humans hit some rocks together to actually viewing them as skilled craftsmen who carefully fine-tuned their tools. We also learned a little about what research is like as Prof. used his own pictures to teach us what surveying is and the other tools archaeologists use in the field. This class also tackled the importance of archaeology today and how to respectfully work with the direct descendants of the artifacts/sites studied, aka how to not continually shit on native and First Nation people. We covered some modern policies that help them reclaim the bones and artifacts that we stole from them as well as the struggle between science and respect. This class just brought up so many different points that forced my mindset to open as I had to imagine who the people behind shiny objects were and I highly highly recommend if you wanna learn about cool things without the stress of a grade."
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A,"This is one of the easiest GEs I took, I definitely recommend taking the class! Lectures were pre-recorded and posted every MWF. Sections are mandatory and participation is required, accounting for 20% of your overall grade. I had Eden as my TA, and she was incredibly nice and accepted answers in the chat as participation. There were 5 bi-weekly exams and the lowest one was dropped; they accounted for the other 80% of your grade. The exams were 1-3 short-essay questions and you had a maximum word count of 700. Although no textbooks were required, Schachner posted 2-3 articles that you have to read. These articles usually pertained to the exams, but I mostly used command-f to look for the answers. The grade you receive for each exam is 80% based on content and 20% based on writing style. I think Eden is a pretty lenient grader, considering I'm not the best writer. I got 3 As and 1 A-, so I didn't bother doing the 5th exam. I got an A as my section grade, even though I feel like I barely participated, and an A as my overall grade. If you have a heavy workload in your other classes, I definitely recommend taking this as a GE since the exams take about an hour each week (max 2 hrs if you're a bad writer like me)."
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A,"Overall this class was pretty chill, but chill as in you don't have a constant workload weighing on you but you'd still have to study pretty hard for the quizzes because they are open book but they're on a time limit and you WON'T have enough time to find individual answers. The class structure is best 4 out of 5 quizzes given every 5 weeks, weekly discussion assignments -- maybe a short 3-4 question quiz or just discussion board posts and one garbology inventory (pretty fun). There's also a paper that counts towards 30% of your grade, it's basically comparing a janky buzzfeed type of clickbait article with it's original source from a journal, best 1 out of 2 papers, so if you do well on the first you can just ignore the second one. Lectures weren't too heavy but I HATED the Australopithecus ape shit and did the absolute worst on that quiz, got about a 87/100 and 100 for the other quizzes (so don't underestimate the work you gotta put in for the quizzes tbh). Lectures were okay, a little monotonous sometimes and he reuses recordings from previous quarters so it might be a little noisy and scratchy but not that big of a problem. To me it was an easy A in terms of if you put in the work, you'll score."
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A,"The tradeoff for this class is that it's boring, but also very straightforward and easy. I appreciated that. Schachner is a G."
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A,"This class is super SUPER easy and doesn't really require too much effort to perform well. Lecture attendance isn't mandatory, but I do recommend it because he posts his slides but they are very brief. What he actually talks about in class is what you will be tested on. He does podcast each lecture though, so if you don't want to go to actual lecture you don't have to. This is an archaeology class so the lectures aren't very interesting, but they aren't hard to follow or pay attention to. There were 3 noncumulative tests (no actual final during finals week) each worth 20% and all multiple choice.  The tests were super easy and all I did to study was read over my notes from class for like 15 min the night before each test. There are also two 4-5 page papers each worth 15% where you compare two articles. They are really easy to write and since they both have the same prompt the second one is even easier to write after knowing how you did on the first one. Discussion attendance is worth 10% of your grade so you do have to go. Discussion was pretty boring but super easy. Also, I never read a single assigned reading so don't worry about those."
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,D,"Harsh grader, not an engaging lecturer. He won’t have mercy even if your first half of scores for the quarter were solid and your TA got changed late in the quarter due to injury with a new out of the loop one. Not a seamless transition and I feel he should have took that into consideration. He doesn’t grade on a curve so don’t drop the ball at any point in the quarter. Workload is heavier than upper division courses. I regret taking his course."
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A," I went into Anthro 2 thinking, ""hey, archaeology has a reputation for being boring, but I bet it'll be interesting because we're at UCLA."" Wrong. Nope. Most boring class I've been in in a long time. I went to class almost every day, but I could absolutely not pay any attention to the lecture for more than 5 minutes. I had to Bruincast (thank god for that) every single lecture and take notes before the exams.  Grade breakdown for Anthro 2 with Schachner:2, four page essays = 15% each, graded by the TA, not hard 3 multiple choice exams = 20% each (not hard if you pay attention in class - everything comes from the lecture, but his slides aren't too fantastic) -- no ""final"" exam. 10% = going to discussion (discussion was boring and useless, but you gotta go for the attendance grade)"
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 2,A," Two 4-5 page papers required. Pretty easy to write. Exams are kind of tricky, make sure to know the overall subject matter and you'll be okay. Lectures are Bruincasted, so you don't really have to go. Discussion is worth points. I never read a single reading assigned and still got an A. I would say that his lectures would be really dry if you aren't interested in what he was talking about. I was kinda interested, so they were okay. Overall, is a decent GE to take."
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,A," Schachner was a great teacher. Class could get boring often, but it might just be my low interest level of the material ( I am a physics major :P). Still, it was a good class and I did learn a lot. Papers were pretty easy, and tests were fair. Take him for GE! I am selling my textbook The Human Past 2nd edition by Scarre (pretty much same as 3rd) . No notes or highlights, and in mint condition. Text me at (818) 585-4397 I can meet on or around campus. Selling for $20 with price negotiable."
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,A,"Maybe I just enjoyed the topic immensely, but I really enjoyed his lectures. He has a slightly monotone voice but it was never a problem. He did a good job of presenting the material you need to know via lecture and the slides. Also helped that I enjoyed his sense of humor. Tried reading the textbook multiple times and found it to be very dense. In my experience, reading the textbook was more useful for  first midterm than the final. Papers were a bit difficult but my TA was a fair grader. I was pleasantly surprised that I got an A in the class."
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Good professor, good class for a GE. Selling my Human Past textbook really cheap: $20. Text me at (818)5854397"
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"In the most recent review, I meant to put Winter 2015, and my overall grade was an A."
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A," Winter 2014 Grade distribution:Weekly discussion section 10%Paper 1 15%Misterm 25%Paper 2 15%Final 35% Professor SchacherThe professor's voice isn't so monotonous as not too unique. Lectures were done with a powerpoint which was posted online as well. It was also podcasted so you could honestly never go to class and learn by yourself. If the podcast doesn't work one day, you can get notes from a friend who actually attended. You do not need the book, so don't buy it. Everything you need to know if given in lecture and his powerpoints. I thought he was a good teacher given the uninteresting content. Weekly discussion section grade: ADiscussion attendance was mandatory. I has Gwyneth Talley, and she was a pretty cool TA. She was helpful in going over content and was pretty chill and approachable. As long as you attend and participate, you should get an A. At the end of the quarter she even bought us donuts because a majority of us sent in evaluations. Paper 1 grade: AThe papers are really straightforward and easy. My TA told us exactly how she wanted our papers formatted, with the length of each section of the paper noted. You basically just pick a prompt covering the material, find an article (one discussion is dedicated to showing you where to look for one), have your TA approve it, and then answer the prompt according to your article. I usually procrastinated and waited until the last minute to do both of my papers, and I still got an A. As long as you're thorough, then you should do well. Midterm grade: A-The midterm was two parts: 20 multiple choice and 2 short answers out of four prompt options. It was incredibly easy and I finished way before the end time. As long as you go over lecture notes and his powerpoints you should be more than fine. Paper 2 grade: AThe second paper was about the same as the first one. Very easy and straightforward. Final grade: B+The final was very similar to the midterm. 1/3 covers material before the midterm and 2/3 covers the rest of the class. It was 40 multiple choice questions and 3 short answers out of 6 prompts. He never wants you to know exact dates, just time frames relative between each event. OverallOverall, this class was fairly boring, but incredibly easy."
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A," Tests are hella easy, just memorize his powerpoints. Don't bother with the reading. The textbook is dense af, I mean like super SUPER dense, and the important stuff, like I said, is from his powerpoints anyway. The reading is a complete waste of time and I stopped after like 3 weeks. He is very well-spoken and knowledgeable, but you can skip class. You know why? Because the important stuff is on the powerpoints. He says the class isn't curved but somehow I always do better on the tests than I expect. 2 bs-y papers, which was probably the hardest part of the class."
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"I took Anthro 8 and I soon learned that I am NOT a fan of studying archaeology. It's definitely really boring and not as interesting as I thought it would be. I had a hard time paying attention in class and retaining any information whatsoever. I didn't read the book, but I studied pretty hard for the midterm and final and got B/B+'s. I had Stephanie as a TA and she was really cool. I got A's on the papers, though they were really challenging. I ended up with a B because the final killed me, but other people said they studied the slides and did really well. It was nice that he put the slides and podcast online, too. Overall, he was a really good lecturer but way too boring and monotone for my taste, mainly due to the subject matter."
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"I took Anthro 8 with Professor Schachner the first quarter of my freshman year, and to this day he is still the best professor I have encountered at UCLA. I have taken Archaeology courses with other professors at UCLA and no one else compares. Schachner's class is very straight-forward and is very manageable if you invest a little bit of time into the class. Not the easiest class, but as a science major this class was nothing. Honestly, I feel the reading is unnecessary if you really pay attention in lecture, participate in discussion, and review before the exams. Schachner is a verrrrrrrry fair grader and makes sure you are successful in his class. He wants the class averages to be high and is very accommodating as long as you show effort. He is one of the best lecturer's on campus and really knows his stuff. All of his lecture presentations are available online so I suggest only copying what he says in class. And his exams are definitely lecture driven. He is very effective at making a arguably dull subject interesting and even makes his lectures humorous. I am very glad to have taken a class with Schachner and I definitely plan on taking a class with him again! "
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"His class was set up to have two papers, one midterm and one final. I guess my one complaint was that the midterm and final were all multiple choice, which I feel is an insufficient method of testing period. He tries to make his lectures a little funny with his dry humor. Good TA's helped a lot with writing the papers and studying for the exams. Overall, an alright professor. Nothing especially good, but he also wasn't bad at all. "
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A," Let me start by saying that I am a south campus science major. For me, this class was beyond boring. Perhaps it was the material, perhaps it was the professor - in all honesty it was most likely a combination. I think Professor Schachner definitely could have done a better job with his lectures. I walked out everyday not knowing what the hell I had just listened to for 50 minutes. He is very monotone...very little excitement at all... which made it hard for me to pay attention. He also has a little habit of walking down the aisles while he is lecturing which really annoyed me for some reason.   I do however like that he posts his powerpoint slides online. Alot of people take advantage of this and skip lecture...I personally still went to every lecture (only missed one), although in hindsight I think I probably could have done okay if I just showed up for the midterm and final. He also posts readings online, but I didn't do any of them...and I got an A. So save yourself the time, because the book goes into way too much detail about things you will never get tested on. You can probably get away with not buying the book because there is a website for the book that has really detailed chapter summaries - I found this site really helpful for studying, although it can also go into too much detail.  Grade is based on midterm (50 questions mult choice), final (75 questions mult choice), 2 five page papers, and participation. Papers were quite time consuming, but the mean and median were about 90 for both. I personally thought the tests in this class were frustrating. First of all, they were really hard to study for because it was nearly impossible to predict what exactly we needed to know. There were tons of dates, places, and other random things to memorize. And the professor was always really vague when telling us what to study. In fact he was actually misleading because he would say not to focus on specific details, but then alot of questions on the tests were related to little things that he maybe brushed over for a minute during lecture. TA's didn't really help either. If I had to give some advice to someone taking the class, I'd say memorize the powerpoint slides and also look up all the sites that he has pictures of on the slides and have a good understanding of those.  Alot of the time I felt like I was in a history class, not an archaeology class. That was my main beef with this course, and I'm not sure if the blame goes to the professor or the department. You would think you'd be learning how archaeologists relate pottery, etc. to sites and how they make general conclusions based on their findings. But instead we were trying to remember if the people in Mesoamerica were cultivating corn or tomatoes in 5000BC. /end rant    "
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"One of the best teachers I ever had. Tests are easy if you study. All the material is online. And the papers are easy, as long as you get your TAs to revise them. Great class and I hate anthropology, I took it as a GE."
Greg Schachner,NA,Principles of Archaeology,ANTHRO 110,N/A," One of the best professors I've had at UCLA. He's very articulate and does a good job of presenting technical, somewhat abstract concepts in ways that are easy to understand. You won't be able to slack off, but it's definitely not the hardest class I've taken. I took Anthro 8 and 110P.  Readings: Readings aren't super necessary, especially in Anthro 8. A bit more so in 110P, but I skimmed the chapters and got an A.  Tests: I had to make up my midterm and final due to scheduling conflicts in Anthro 8 and he was very understanding and flexible. Tests in Anthro 8 are multiple choice, in 110P they are essay based and very fair. He gives you a list of review questions, and the ones on the actual tests are very similar, if not the same. He'll give you a list of 6-7 and you have to pick 4 or so to write, so you do have some choice. He's more concerned with general concepts rather than specifics, so you don't need to waste time memorizing sites. Other assignments: He gives a few short (ie. 1 page) papers in 110P and drops the lowest grade. You definitely have to think about the material, but it's not too hard to get to the main idea."
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology of North America,ANTHRO 113P,N/A," He is a very knowledgeable professor and very cute! The things you have to do in this class to get an A. 1. Attend Class and take notes, he has power points online but he has said himself those are there to help him!2. Memorize sites on a map, they will be on the exam. He has two papers for his class, both are two pagers. Really easy in my opinion. He will have you summarize two articles he picks and have you synthesis them in a cohesive well written manner. Just don't be lazy and write them a night before. His exams aren't that difficult it is just a lot you have to memorize. I stopped reading the book after 4th week, but sometimes if you are stuck on a concept the book will help."
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeology of North America,ANTHRO 113P,N/A,His grading is horrible.
Greg Schachner,NA,Southwestern Archaeology,ANTHRO 113R,A-,"The class wasn't too bad, considering my lack of interest in archaeology. The class was fairly straightforward and mostly based on lectures for exams. Exams are short-essays."
Greg Schachner,NA,Archaeological Field Training,ANTHRO 115P,N/A," His class, ""The Politics of Past"" has been one of my favorite classes at UCLA so far. If you think you are considering a profession in archaeology, this class is a must.  Not only did I learn a lot about museums, collecting, NAGPRA, etc., but you learn so much about how archaeology really gets done -- and how so much of the field really isn't about just the science of it.  This class has a decent amount of reading each week, but its not too dry. Class is structured as a ""seminar"" of sorts. Generally, Professor Schachner lectures or shares stories for part of the class. Then the class usually breaks up into groups to discuss, or there is just a general class discussion. Overall, class wasn't too boring, and was sometimes pretty entertaining. Your grade in the class is based off of participation, a take home midterm, a museum project, and a final paper. None of these were overly difficult. The Professor always responded to my e-mails in a timely manner, even on Saturdays, and gave great feedback on papers. He cares a lot about writing, and that shows in his grading. However, he recognizes hard work and improvement.  I got an A in his class and I definitely recommend this class to others!"
Charles Stanish,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A," Since I took this class as a GE, I can't really comment on Professor Stanish's ability as a teacher, but he seemed alright. His lectures were pretty straightforward, but you have to attend, since his exams tests you on readings and lectures. Sometimes he rambles on and then goes off on a random anecdote, so its hard to stay focused, but as long as you take away the key points from his lecture that should be good enough. If he says alot of stuff, he'll post the powerpoint online. The grading scheme was made up of 2 midterms, 1 final and discussion section (which was mandatory), which was 25% each. Pretty much, he grades it so that you have to get an average of an A on at least 3/4 things to get an A in the class, so don't slack off on the midterms. His tests are long, composed of multiple choice, true/false, and short answer, and yes some of the questions are kind of vague. Pretty much you just have to cram your answers full of information to get credit. He does curve generously though. One midterm was out of 300 points (yes, his grading is kind of weird), and he set a 200/300 as the limit for an A. However, the drop-off from an A to a B, B-C, C-D was pretty low, with like a difference of 20 some points. So if you don't get within the range for an A, its very easy to get a C or below.  Pretty much, just attend lecture, take decent notes, and read all of his articles. He assigns alot and some are really dense. Also attend the guest lectures, because he will test you on those too. Overall, take this class with him for the easy A if you can withstand ALOT of reading and taking notes."
Charles Stanish,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A," Good professor. He's funny as shit, too.  Go to class and you're good for the exams.There's 3 of them (2 midterms and a final), and none of them are cumulative. They're 25% each, with the final 25% being allocated to the discussion sections, which are all pretty much straight forward (you have to read an article for each one, but they're all short and fun). His averages were in the 60's, but he curves generously. I don't really like archaeology, but his class definitely made me want to go to Perú and Mesoamerica."
Charles Stanish,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"Professor Stanish is one of the nicest professors I have encountered at UCLA. I dont know what people are complaining about. He wants the same respect that you would want from other people if you are talking.  I don't think getting frustrated at people having side conversations while you're lecturing is out of context. He totally has grounds for telling those people to be quiet because it not only bothers him, but other students too.  The midterm was fair.  A lot of people in my class scored high on it.  There were a lot of information to take in, but the TA's give you a list of important concepts to know week by week and basically everything that was on the midterm were on the sheets.  His lectures were interesting for me, even as a freshman whose just taking this class for a GE.  So go figure.  I dont think Professor Stanish is the problem, the class just requires you to memorize a lot of information, making it the same as any other class at UCLA. He's really nice. At first, I was afraid of him.  But I approached him for help, and he gladly did it without any complaints. The man is available outside of class.  Dont think this is a good review because I'm getting a good grade; in fact, im getting an average grade in his class right now so I'm not being biased at all.  Basically, Im going to break it down for you: Discussion 20%, Paper (3-4 pages long) 10%, Midterm 30%, Final 40%.  I think it's totally fair."
Charles Stanish,NA,Archaeology of Chiefdoms,ANTHRO 112Q,N/A,This class had a lot of work (3 15 page papers and tons of reading) but he graded them pretty nicely if he could see you did the reading and connected it to ideas. He didn't nitpick at them or anything. If you do the work this class is an easy A.
Charles Stanish,NA,Ancient Civilizations of Andean South America,ANTHRO 114Q,A,"I absolutely loved this class. I learned so much and was thoroughly engaged. Dr. Stanish is understanding and respectful to the fact that we are putting our time, money, and effort into his class, and he makes it well worth it! He is incredibly supportive but still has high standards for his students. Easily one of my favorite classes I've ever taken."
Charles Stanish,NA,Economic Anthropology,ANTHRO 143,N/A," The first two lectures about economics, anthropology and game theory were highly interesting. He lost my attention after that as his points weren't as interesting as they were during the first lectures. Most of the points were relating archaeology and it was hard to see how practical this was compared to the first few lectures His exams were 6 essay questions midterm and 12 essay questions final, if i remember, and he lets you do a 6 or 12 paper to adjust the weight of your final exam gradeif you choose to I really didn't think he was that interesting and the course got tedious with the readings thereafter. For the exams, it was just too much writing and seemed to be based on whether you can pull interesting facts from the articles. For each article pull at least 5 main points and for each essay you can throw out all the points then you'll get a good grade. I should've gotten a better grade on the final but the latter half of the course wasn't as clear as the first half so I got a B Bleh class and least memorable, except for when he gave $20 away that's the only thing I'll remember"
Charles Stanish,NA,Economic Anthropology,ANTHRO 143,N/A,"Stanish is a great teacher! He knows what hes talking about but he is also very entertaining. Because he was so excited about the material, it made me excited about it. The material was no difficult to understand and the readings were interesting. He goes over the material in class as well, but skimming over it will be useful for the midterm and final, for extra detials, he loves that. There is only one midterm and one final composed of short answer questions, around 7 or 8, i cant remember exactly. However, if you take good notes in class and skim the material you will do real well. I got an A in the class, not gloating, just saying i didnt spread myself thin trying to reach that, probably cause i really took an interest in what he was saying. He was one of my favorite teachers at UCLA."
Charles Stanish,NA,Economic Anthropology,ANTHRO 143,N/A," Professor Stanish is quite interesting.  Basically, this is the deal. Until you do all the readings, you really won't get what the HECK is going on in the class. He goes off tangents (with some crazy stories) and doesn't really explain very clearly (or in order) the ideas that follow. I would recommend going to his office hours or asking him to repeat each idea. With that said, he is an incredibly interesting and fun person.  The readings- DO THEM! He will have EXPLICIT questions on the readings as well as the notes. However, it shouldn't be that intense. I went to all the lectures (the first class I actually did it for) and I did the readings the day before the midterm and got an A- on the midterm. Make sure to highlight and remember interesting information and that will get you the points you need. Students didn't do too well on it because they didn't do the reading but it is NECESSARY. The readings (except of a couple) is usually short and not too dense.  Grading- the midterm was EXTREMELY long to write and very little time. The final was about 15 to 16 pages and followed the same format. Students disliked the fact he put quotes and those were the ones students did very bad on. It is quite insane to write 15 to 16 pages but doable. Again, I didn't have so much time to study for the final (since I was taking 17 units) but I got an A in the course.  If you do bad on the midterm, he gives you a few plans you can chose from (along with a more weighted cumulative final). If you do well, your final will not be cumulative.  Summary- He is a good professor to take but make sure to take good notes, do the readings, and review everything thoroughly before the exams. "
Charles Stanish,NA,Economic Anthropology,ANTHRO 143,N/A,"Prof. Stanish is the worst professor I have ever had, albeit one of the easiest. I could not tolerate his lectures primarily due to his tendency to mumble and go off tangent and start telling us his life story for half an hour at a time. Incidentally I did not learn anything in this class that I found useful or relevant to my life, and by the end I was so frustrated that I switched out of the anthro major. Basically if you manage to go to every lecture and jot down all the little details he mumbles, skim over the readings, and spend some time studying the lecture notes for the two exams, you should get an A no problem."
Charles Stanish,NA,Economic Anthropology,ANTHRO 143,N/A,BEST CLASS EVER!!!
Charles Stanish,NA,Economic Anthropology,ANTHRO 143,N/A,"Great teacher, very passionate about the subject. He assigned a decent amoount of articles, nothing really overwhelming, and his tests are very manageable."
Alexei N. Vranich,NA,Ancient Civilizations of Andean South America,ANTHRO 114Q,N/A,"Dr. Alexei is HILARIOUS! He is by far one of the greatest professors that I have had at UCLA. He is very concerned about the grades that his students make and is always willing to give outside help to ensure the success of those taking his class. Without a doubt, I would take his class again. If you are interested in Anthropology, and especially South American Archaeology, then you would be fortunate to take this class. Alexei is very confident in his knowledge. His class is not easy, nor is it difficult. If you are interested in South American Archaeo, then this class is fair and interesting."
Alexei N. Vranich,NA,Cultures of Pacific,ANTHRO 168P,N/A,"Professor Vranich has so far been one of my favorites. I am currently taking Religion 177 with him and I always look forward to class. He brings a sense of humor to his lectures and connects with students in a way that engages them to want to learn. He does require readings but most of the classes he teaches are very interesting, so the readings are not dull nor boring. I recommend taking a class with him! "
Susan Perry,NA,Fiat Lux Freshman Seminars,ANTHRO 19,F,"I took Long-term Animal Behavior in my freshman fall quarter. The class is NOT as fun as it sounds. It mainly focused on monkeys and some scientific methods scientists use when observing animals. Each student was required to read a book and share with the class. Dr. Perry is undoubtedly an amazing researcher, but not a really interesting lecturer. Plus, you have to attend every lecture to pass the class. Would recommend to anthropology majors and those who are interested in monkeys."
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,A,"From the beginning, I loved Professor Perry. She was so kind and helpful during the remote instruction quarter and battled horrible internet connection and her limited technological knowledge to still provide us with the best class experience possible. Every week we would have a quiz and in the end, we were able to drop three of our lowest quiz scores which was more than generous. I do have to admit that the quizzes were a bit tricky and some of them asked about specific details so you do really have to know your stuff.Other than that, she replies to student emails really quickly and really cares about students' mental health and learning as she provided us with alternatives if we were unable to purchase the course reader (which I do not recommend purchasing anyways because I did none of the readings and got an A) and even posted recipes and resources for students that need help cooking during the stay-at-home order. Definitely take this class if you love animals (monkeys in particular); not only will you learn about their lifestyle but also how their behavior is paralleled in humans and other species."
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,A,"Her class is graded on a curve such that only 33% of the class gets each grade, A,B and C, So no one fails. Her powerpoints contain audio with critical information."
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,B+,"Def take this class, hella easy, super insightful, Prof Perry is so nice, kind, helpful and smart. Really cool class on monkeys."
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,B+,"The class was a little bit harder than I was ready for but I still really, really enjoyed it. The book for the class was written by her and is incredibly interesting and she is one of the foremost in the field of studying white-faced capuchin monkeys. I would have loved to take her class in person as the lectures were a little bit dull through PowerPoint but still super interesting. The quizzes were fairly hard, really, really study before them and you should be fine but they're a bit awkwardly worded so it can be hard to get every one right. But she is flexible with the grades and lets you drop the lowest two. She also is super sweet and offers a lot of resources, for the class and otherwise, another reason why I wish I could take her class in person. Overall, if you like animals, especially monkeys, and animal behavior this is a great class!"
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,C+," Took this class online Spring 2020. Professor Perry's lectures were clear and the class overall doesn't require too much of your time. I think the topics were very interesting. She is very responsive when it comes to replying back to emails. I don't regret taking this course. Her grading was based off only weekly quizzes, no final or midterms. She is very passionate about her work.  I did end up with a 79.45% and emailed her and she wasn't willing to  round me up to a B- Reselling the course reader, email: 331499mg@gmail.com"
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,B,"It should be fair to consider that I took this class during the Spring 2020 Covid-19 outbreak. With that said take this review with partiality, because I was not able to receive a full intellectual experience in-person. I have read here in the reviews that she gave in-class short essay exams for the midterm and final. But for distant learning she gave us weekly quizzes. Each quiz consisted of 10 multiple choice questions each. I have to say these quizzes required you to know the weekly material in very fine detail. She also assigns weekly readings which comprise of her book and a course reader that includes several research articles. Her book cost $35 and the course reader cost $28. You’ll have to make a trip into Westwood to purchase the course reader because you can not purchase it online or on campus. I’m not sure if she used slides in class pre-Covid outbreak but for us she uploaded slides with audio commentary to further explain the material. I learned a lot about sexual selection, social intelligence, primate taxonomy, dominance and the evolution of intelligence. This class is not difficult, but it’s not an easy A. I probably spent more time studying for this class then my other two classes and I still got a B. I really enjoyed her class, she seems very approachable if you have questions, and she added all types of interesting optional assignments (how to write grant proposals, primate research opportunities, and tons of other interesting stuff if you want to further your academic career in research). I would definitely recommend this class if you’re interested in primate behavior."
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,A,"I took this class spring 2020, so I'm not sure how relevant the coursework we did will be to other quarters (unless you're taking the class also online). Our grade originally consisted of 9 quizzes (no midterm, no final) the lowest 2 of which you could drop. At the end of the quarter, Professor Perry changed this to be able to drop the lowest 3, due to the BLM protests. The class is curved, but only to help student grades (i.e. you will never receive a grade lower than the percentage that you earned). The quizzes were not difficult, as long as you did the readings, listened to lectures and took notes. Most of the lectures there were lecture notes provided, with most of the important information (you did need to add some details from the narrated powerpoints she provided). They were just ccle quizzes, 10 MC questions each week. The main reason I am writing this review, is that Professor Perry, out of all my professors this quarter, was the most accommodating given the transition to online classes, coronavirus, and now of course the BLM protests. You can tell she is very passionate about what she does, the subject is interesting enough, and she really cares about students mental health. She provided alternative sources for readings from the course reader so students didn't have to buy it, and the chapters from her book are also available online. Overall, Professor Perry is one of the nicest professors I have ever had at UCLA and I would honestly recommend taking the course just for this professor, she is so kind and teaches the material earnestly."
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,B,"I hated this class. Got an A on the midterm and then failed the final. It was so incredibly boring and unclear, tests were written badly, and the class was not what was in the description. She only talks about her own research, makes you buy books she has written, and has ridiculously specific test questions about what the name of the money is who did a specific action in the book. Don't take this class. She also plays really long videos in the dark, and i fell asleep in class for the first time ever."
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,B,"This class is the first time I have ever fallen asleep in class. It is boring and seems easy, until it is inexplicably incredibly difficult-not because of content, but because of badly worded multiple choice questions. I got an A on the midterm and failed the final. She makes absolutely no sense in her test questions, and each question counts for 1% of your grade.  Her slides are black and white with few pictures. She keeps the classroom pitch dark but doesn't allow laptops so you cant see your notes. This class is just basic evolution and then random details about any of the monkeys you talk about over the 10 weeks-and really random details at that. the grade is based solely on the midterm and final, which correspond in no tangible way to the lecture nor the readings. I did and understood all the readings for the final and still failed. I would not recommend this class to anyone."
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,A,"I liked this class, lots of review and repetition of similar material if you're an EEB major and have taken EEB100 or evolution/animal behavior related courses. Just more focus on monkeys. I found a lot of the material to be interesting, not too complicated, she makes the exams fair and the readings are probably important in doing well in the class. If you go to every lecture and are alert and take notes (I'd recommend printing the lectures out beforehand and adding notes on them in class) you should be more than fine. Her final exam was more difficult than the midterm for sure, but she bases the grades on a curve so the top 33% of the class gets an A, the following a B, and the lowest a C. Definitely a good course with a light workload and not too much stress involved."
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,B,"I enjoyed this class! took is as an elective as bio major and I must say there is a lot of overlap between 128P and EEB 100 which I really enjoyed since I was taking them at the same time! Her multiple choice questions are FAIR but some harder than others and you have to pay close attention to her slides as all the answers ARE there and there are NO surprises. She actually made me care about a subject I didn't care about before and made an effort to learn names of students which I liked! She has a very friendly and approachable nature and you can tell she knows her stuff and is definitely one of the most intelligent professors i've had at UCLA! Would recommend her class, favorite part was there was no discussion just lectures twice a week and the reading for the class (Manipulative Monkeys) was actually a VERY enjoyable read!"
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,A,"Perry writes the textbook for the class, and has contributed valuable research in her field. She is very nice and helpful, but the lectures can a bit dull or monotone if you aren't engaging with the material. Exams were graded so that top 1/3 middle 1/3 and bottom 1/3 receive an A , B , and C respectively.  Perry is obviously very smart and you do need to do the readings if you want to receive an A on the exam; however, her textbook is quite interesting so its not a tough read (i hate reading).  Lastly, my TA was Kotrina, and she was very friendly, knowledgable, and helpful."
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,A-,"BEWARE! Her tests are extremely difficult and she has to curve them a ridiculous amount. I got a D on the final and it was curved to an A. I'm happy to have gotten an A but the time I took studying for the final could have spent on another class more worthy of it. Additionally, I would have liked to know that I left the class having learned something. So ya, kind of easy... but awful teacher."
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,N/A,"If you have an interest in primatology and human origin you will likely enjoy this class. Susan Perry has worked with capuchin monkeys for over 20 years, so she is able to supplement her lectures with examples from her own research. She is very available to help, offering two chances to have lunch with her! The final was cumulative and 60% of the grade, midterm 40%. There is an almost overwhelming amount of information to know, but the fact that it is so interesting makes it easier to cope with. Regardless of your grade, you'll leave this class feeling like you've learned so much. And you'll be able to apply what you've learned to almost everything. It's such a fascinating course and Susan Perry is a fascinating person. "
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,N/A,"Absolutely loved this class. If you are interested in primates, this is definitely the course for you. Professor Perry is very accessible and has office hours all the time, plus informal lunches that are great for discussing primate related things (and things not related to primates at all) with the professor and your classmates. The book was a quick and fun read: think Game of Thrones, with monkeys. Unfortunately, I doubt I'll be getting an A in this class, but that is due to frequent absences for health related reasons and my general inability to take tests. This was a class that I really always looked forward to going to even though it was a morning class. Not a lecture went by without fun and educational anecdotes about various primates (mostly capuchins). The midterm was difficult for me, as I was sleep deprived and stressed out about things unrelated to the class, but the grade was curved so that helped people who didn't do as terribly as I did. In spite of the fact that I am very obsessed with getting a 4.0 and died a little inside when I saw my midterm grade, I don't at all regret taking this class because I've learned so much from it, and isn't that what going to a good school like UCLA is supposed to be about? This class changed my perspective on how human beings fit into the tree of life and the universe (as cheesy as that sounds). 10/10 would recommend this class to anyone with the slightest interest in animals."
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,N/A,"Instead of Chimpanzee Politics, she should make The Selfish Gene a course text. The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins is pretty much her entire course, which I'm suspecting she modeled her course from. "
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,N/A,"Professor Perry's class was enjoyable and I learned a lot about primatology. You are pretty much forced to learn a lot. The lectures cover a lot of material and the course reader readings are kind of intense (other than the text book itself, which perry wrote,and is entertaining). Tests are rough but she curves them and that helps a bunch. Work hard and you will be able to get an A. "
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,N/A,"The gist of the class is that monkeys have dramas just like WE do. Imagine watching an MTV reality show while taking a basic Evolutionary Biology course. Oowala!, you get 128A. Sure it is interesting at first to see some of the resemblance, but overkill with monotony after the 3rd week. You have to read two books: Chimpanzee Politics and the one that she wrote, Manipulative Monkeys. Much of the contexts of the two books are identical, which is like beating a dead ape by making us read them both. If you're really into Primatology,go for it. If not then spare yourself the monkey chatter. Overall the class is not hard. "
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,N/A,The most pointless class I have ever encountered at UCLA. Do NOT take this class unless you feel like being tested on extremely specific irrelevant facts about monkeys. The final project isn't too hard but the grading scale is ridiculous. Don't take this class it sucks and the professor sucks more.
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,N/A,"If anyone needs the book and course reader for 128a, please message me at jonathanL1991@ucla.edu. I am selling both of them. "
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,N/A,"If anyone needs the book and course reader 128a, I am selling both of them. Please message me if you are interested."
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,N/A,"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! She is a nice person and has a the most wonderful stories about her time in Costa Rica. However, she does not teach well at all. For our final, she tried to 'prevent cheating' and tried to stagger small groups of student to take the final at different times. Between checking every single student in individually and giving them assigned seating, some students had an unfair advantage of having more time for the final. Others were only given 1.5 hours of the 3 given. She is blatantly unconcerned and unwilling to take responsibility for her actions. If you do not need this class, do not take it."
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,N/A,"I got an A and I really enjoyed her. This is not an easy class. I worked my butt off. I studied a lot, did all the reading, attended nearly every lecture and got notes for the ones I missed and I visited her in her office hours at least 5 times. That is how you get an A in her class. You can't fake your way through this class.  She is very available and it's worth it to go to office hours because she really explains things that can be confusing. You can't ask for a more available prof. I learned a lot and I appreciated her enthusiasm about her work. Im not going to be a primatologist, but this class was worth taking. Learn the specifics of each monkey, not just general ideas if you want to do well on her tests."
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,N/A,"Honestly, this class isn't just hard.....it's pointless. Unless you really are into monkeys (specifically Capuchins), then don't bother taking Perry. Her book is all about her research on Capuchins, which would have been fine but I was interested in getting a broader perspective and I didn't. Sucks. I am a good student and Anthro major, but this class was a pain in my neck. She counts attendance in lecture (which consists of over 100 people---ridiculous!) and expects you to participate. That would all be OK , STILL.....if only her lectures weren't as faced-paced and disjointed as they were. She doesn't lecture on a continuous topic, she speaks wayyyyy to fast, and gives tiny details that don't really relate to class that end up on her hard quizzes. I guess I should've sat in the front, kissed her ass, and asked a question everytime I was confused (hmm...would have been every minute of every lecture). But you know I just couldn't care about this class as much as I wanted to, and she didn't make it interesting. Even Section was boring, they don't go over the important things on the quizzes and spent FAR too much time explaining BS and stuff about the Final Project. Take another class. "
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,N/A,"Professor Perry barely teached; she basically just read off of the slides. She was incredibly boring. Her tests were too difficult and she didn't offer much space for improvement. Also, she's really strict about attendance and marks off for every time you don't show up. I wouldn't reccommend this Professor."
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,N/A,"I just finished this class, and I'm posting this without knowing how I did grade-wise, but I just want to say that I thought Prof Perry was an amazing professor and the course was interesting and timely.  Some complained that she was too difficult, but I think she just had high expectations of us as UCLA Jrs & Srs.  She was so willing to answer questions, slow down her lecture pace and meet up outside of class to help, couldn't ask for a more available professor.  If you are at all interested in evolution, ecology or primatology, this class is a must take.  It won't be easy, but it'll be worth it."
Susan Perry,NA,Primate Behavior Nonhuman to Human,ANTHRO 128P,N/A,"I really enjoyed this class.  I found the lectures and readings interesting (could b cuz im an anthro major) but learning about monkeys is interesting too.  Prof. Perry also included antecdotes from her fieldwork which are amusing.  This class is so far one of the easier anthro classes I've taken.  Only bad aspect would be her soft voice in a large classroom.  Discussions are a breeze, along with the monkey project."
Mi Kyung Kim,NA,"Critical Study of Health, Sickness, and Healing in Global Perspective",SOC GEN 85,B,"She is a great professor and her lectures are always interesting. There is a bit of reading necessary for the clicker quizzes, but in my opinion the readings are super interesting as they are about real accounts of how a disease like ebola, measles, etc. affected someone. There is no midterm or final, however there is one final paper and she is an extremely tough grader. I took that paper to  her office hours, to the writing center twice, got it proof read by my grad school brother, and a peer, and I still got a B. But I know quite a few people got A's on it so maybe thats just my own fault, and she is a great professor so take this class if you get the chance."
Mi Kyung Kim,NA,"Critical Study of Health, Sickness, and Healing in Global Perspective",SOC GEN 85,N/A,If you're not in to the subject then the class can be very dry. There is also a ton of reading. Other than that the class is great. Professor Kim is a very good teacher and lecturer and is very helpful.
Mi Kyung Kim,NA,Anthropology of Food,ANTHRO 133,A-," Note: This is a review for Anthro 146 (Urban Anthropology). However, it could be relevant if you’re contemplating taking one of her courses.  So, I took Anthro 146, in the summer not knowing who the instructor was. I think the person the department had in mind dropped out at the last moment and Dr. Kim filled the position (I’m not sure). But I’m happy our instructor was Dr. Kim. Her class was not hard, but it was not an easy A. Weekly assignments consisted of short scholarly readings and short essay reflections (500 word count). She gives interesting lectures and she certainly has a sense of humor.  Yet, she is very idiosyncratic about writing assignments (grammar, punctuation and the substance of your writing), this also includes the format in how you email her (make sure it’s with a formal approach). We did not have a midterm because it was a six-week course; however, we did have a final five-page essay (I heard she varies between MCQ and Essays for the final). Keep in mind, that you’ll  have to participate in class and that will reflect in your final grade. Overall, I would take another course with her and I would recommend her class to another student."
Mi Kyung Kim,NA,Anthropology of Food,ANTHRO 133,A," *NOTE: This is a review for Dr. Kim's ANTHRO 146 (Urban Anthropology) class that I took  online over summer 2020 and posted my review here because ANTHRO 146 was not listed under Dr. Kim in Bruinwalk.* As a human being, Dr. Kim is a very caring teacher who will do her best to make sure that her students both have a voice in the class and understand the material at hand. During the summer online class, she would post discussion questions in the zoom chat to make sure everyone understood the material and if someone didn’t, would repeat/go over the material she just explained.  As a presenter, her lectures were more structured on her talking rather than putting up key or detailed bullet points on a slide, which can be tough if you are someone who relies on visuals or key words to note what’s actually important.  During the 6 weeks, we had assigned readings (usually web articles) one 300 page response paper due every week and one 1,250 word Final Paper, which I think was doable.  So overall, Dr. Kim is a sweet, Non-BS caring teacher interested in your well-being and will do what she can to make sure you succeed. However, the loose structure of the class can make taking notes tough, especially when talking about more non-tangible ideas such as Urban Anthropology.  So I would definitely recommend to take her as long as you are prepared for a more loosely structured class with more discussions and critical thinking involved."
Mi Kyung Kim,NA,Anthropology of Food,ANTHRO 133,A,"The readings are all free and she provides them so there's no issue there. She tends to go off topic and frequently gets lost on tangents (interesting tangents, but they don't relate to the class or material). I found myself thinking how does this relate to the class? can we circle back to class? is this anthro of food anymore? The class could be done better on her part, but if you're interested in the topic you'll enjoy it nonetheless."
Mi Kyung Kim,NA,Anthropology of Food,ANTHRO 133,A,this class is now just Anthropology 133. Prof. Kim is great and extremely knowledgeable on the subject.  I think this class is only offered during the summer so there are no discussion sections. Participation is important through class discussions and clicker questions. She did assign a good amount of reading but it was doable and most were very interesting.  also there was a short research paper open prompt but related to class. she was friendly and willing to make herself available to help with our essays and any other questions/concerns.
Mi Kyung Kim,NA,Food and Health in Global Perspective,SOC GEN 134,C,"This class would have been interesting, but the main reason I had issue with this class is because this professor picks favorites. She is clearly bias towards certain students, and treats other students like shit. Also be careful if you plan to record lectures because she will call you out. She is rude and honestly seems like she hates her job. Obviously take this with a grain of salt considering I got a C in the class. If you're looking for an easy A, don't come here. Her exams are multiple choice, but are so detailed, its impossible to know everything. And her final paper asks you to come up with an original research topic, without really having time to do the research. Also, this class was much more STEM based than I had anticipated, and I am a north campus major soooo yeah, not for me."
Mi Kyung Kim,NA,Food and Health in Global Perspective,SOC GEN 134,B," This is a review for Food Studies 159 since it is the new Soc Gen 134.  Pros:Her lectures are really fun to listen to and very interesting.  She's pretty cool to talk to in office hours and does go over tips on papers and exams.  Cons: Her exams are pretty hard. They're hard because her answer choices can be pretty confusing. Although it does require you to know your stuff very well, often times, I don't really know whether to go off of the reading or to go by the lecture. I also feel like I miss key information in lecture and when I ask her about it, she told me to ask someone else in the class. Whether that's bad or not is up to you. She grades the writing assignments pretty hard. She's a stickler when it comes to good grammar, proper tone, and the content that you talk about. You would have to be a really really good writer in order to get an A on the writing assignments. I normally get A's on all my writing assignments for other classes, which are mainly upper division sociology classes, but this is the first class where I got a C+ on a big essay (the final research paper), so unless you are super insanely confident in your writing skills, I wouldn't depend on the writing assignments to raise your grade. She doesn't allow computers in class, so you're going to have to write all the notes out, so you're going to have to be very vigilant in writing everything down. Make sure to ask someone around you if you miss anything (due to my point above).  Takeaway:I really like this professor, but her grading scheme is pretty difficult. I wouldn't take this class if you are looking for an easy A, but if you don't care about grades and are looking for an interesting lecturer, this class is for you."
Mi Kyung Kim,NA,Food and Health in Global Perspective,SOC GEN 134,N/A,"okay look. she's great as a person. really makes you want to be liked by her. but it's a HARD class if you're not an HBS major or stem or if you're hella north campus. the amount of reading is insane and you need to do it to do well on the exams, which are vague and hard. she didn't give much direction for the research paper either. she had this high standard she wanted us to live up to but treated us like idiots with her extra resources she put online about how to write an email. idk, i wish the class was paced more realistically."
Mi Kyung Kim,NA,Food and Health in Global Perspective,SOC GEN 134,B," Class and lectures are interesting, but the topics of the class are run into the ground. Shes an interesting lecturer, but theres so much participation by people in the class trying to get credit with the most inane crap, it made me really dislike the people in the major. The amount of times people volunteered information we had learned in another soc gen class only to act like they came up with it is way too high. And I just dont care that you have a vegan friend or that your grandma drinks raw milk or that you've traveled the world with your parents money and saw that some people have some random dietary difference we all already knew about Tests were really hard because they tested on technicalities, and there were many times when I was debating if the answers go by reading or what she said in lecture which diverge slightly, or where I felt the right answer was more of an opinion than a fact. Other times i was just like, what?? Why is this random tidbit of info what were getting tested on?? 2 multiple choice tests, plus a final paper. If your interested in the material, the basis of this class is mostly stuff you already know, but that doesnt make it easy. Shes really nice in office hours, but not very helpful"
Mi Kyung Kim,NA,Food and Health in Global Perspective,SOC GEN 134,A-,"I really enjoyed this class and would consider it my favorite class I have taken at UCLA.  The material is not too difficult and is very interesting. Professor Kim is very funny, engaging, and personable and creates a classroom environment where students get to know one another and feel encouraged to share any thoughts or insights. There are two 50 question multiple choice exams, two short documentary responses, a final research essay, and participation points. The tests are rather simple and you will do well on them if you review the material closely.  The only thing that bothered me about this class was that there were a lot of participation points and during certain classes Professor Kim would only give students full credit if they raised their hand to share or answer a question. It sometimes became difficult to get called on when every other student was also trying to get called on and it would also be hard to participate if a student did not have any prior background knowledge in the subject. Overall great class and I still 100% recommend taking it!"
Mi Kyung Kim,NA,Food and Health in Global Perspective,SOC GEN 134,A-,"I enjoyed Prof. Kim's class so much. I'm surprised she doesn't have any reviews so I thought I'd add the first one.  I would definitely recommend taking this class. She teaches so much about food systems and how they came to be. She also isn't biased when she teaches about food. She always presents both sides.  Definitely take this class with her!      Her tests are very detailed so take good notes.  Also, participation matters so don't miss class. She gives a couple assignments during the quarter which are based on films. She also assigns a paper on a topic of your choice that is 1/3 of your grade so definitely start early and go to her office hours for help."
Mi Kyung Kim,NA,Culture and Personality,SOCIOL 134,A," Not gonna lie, when I saw the syllabus and watched the first lecture I was intimidated and thought the class would be difficult, but it wasn't as bad as I thought. Overall it was a pretty good class. The lectures were pre-recorded and the instructions to assignments were all extremely clear.  The readings are a lot, but not too hard to get through. Personally, I used a text-to-speech website to help me read them faster. Some articles are very interesting whereas others are very dense and even when I re-read them I still didn't understand them. There are assignments related to the readings that help you understand the material and honestly keep you from procrastinating.  The final essay instructions and rubric are very clear.  There were no quizzes/tests, just the assigned sources reading assignments, 3 reflections about COVID/personality/culture, and the final essay.  She's very straight-forward. Discussion was cool and helped breakdown the week's reading and overall main points. Ty was my TA and he broke things down really well and was super helpful."
Mi Kyung Kim,NA,Sociology of Deviant Behavior,SOCIOL 145,B+," I didn't even need this class, but Dr. Kim was hilarious and outrageous in her lectures, it made me want to stay and learn. SUCH a huge mistake, especially taking 4 classes Fall Quarter. This is the FIRST B+ I ever received in Sociology. As an Anthropology professor, she was clearly confused on some terms or ideas, and had to refer to her PhD TAs for information or correction, so this caused a lot of confusion throughout class, ESPECIALLY on the ridiculous test questions. Her tests were SO wordy, that it was difficult to read, and her answers were just as ridiculous. I would never take this class again. The only students who did well, are ones that have previously taken Sociology of Crime, which is based on the same ideas. Dr. Kim was hilarious, and she said some outrageous things, but it was definitely not worth the headache or the GPA dropped. Again, the ideas were clear and easy to understand her tests are what made it very hard to pass. What made me mad is that I actually did fairly well on the first test (midterm), however I did worse on the final. She said she would give extra credit to those who did better on the midterm, and I call that BS. They said the final was easier than the midterm, but how was it that I did worse, if I studied harder if not longer than the midterm? Only redeeming factor was that my TA was amazing and very kind and understanding.  She does not allow computers, or talking, and absolutely hates it when we try to put our stuff away. Also there was always this one student in class that would suggest movies we should watch, and Dr. Kim would encourage the conversation which was one of the many reasons why we would ALWAYS be behind in class lectures. I always study hard and have earned my As, however, I felt so cheated in this class and by this Professor. B+ is a better grade than most of the students in class. The class average for the midterm was 65%. The final was 70%, which she did curve in both instances, but final she barely curved, because she only cared the class average was at least 74%. One of the students I know who is a Regent's Scholar, got a B. A, freaking B. This person is an honors student, was given this prestigious University of California full-ride scholarship, which is hard for students to obtain, based on their application, profile, leadership experience and grades... it was his first B as well. It's not the end of the world, but I worked hard for my 3.94, just to have it dropped by some shitty professor's test. She claims she was the first in her class, so she teaches it as if we were all first in our class, and her lectures she always assumes that there are NO students who are older, like myself. ""You don't know this, you weren't alive for this, you don't remember this"" very annoying."
Mi Kyung Kim,NA,Sociology of Deviant Behavior,SOCIOL 145,A-,"This was probably one of the worst Professors I have ever taken. It was such an interesting topic, yet she made it so difficult. The class considered of 2 exams worth 25% of your grade, along with a final paper that made up for 30% of your grade. Her exams were multiple choice, however they were so subjective that no matter how much you studied, it was still so difficult. I spent 2 weeks studying for her exams only to receive low B's on both of them. The TAs also had a hard time dealing with her so it wasn't only the students. Thankfully I had a wonderful TA who actually cared about the effort his students were putting in. However, there was only so much he could do. The multiple choice options consisted of A, A and B, A B and C, all of the above, none of the above, etc. (very irritating). Before we took the exam, she sent out a mass email saying that she's not trying to trick us yet it was so obvious by the end of the quarter that she really was. She showed the TAs the first exam before she gave it to her students, and then switched it up last minute to her own benefit. The TAs themselves even said they couldn't have taken that exam because it was way too difficult. Essentially, please try taking any other professor but Dr. Kim. Although the subject is super interesting, it just isn't worth it. I cannot explain my level of hate for this class. She's just a bitter lady who wants to watch her students receive low GPAs because UCLA was difficult for her."
Alan Fiske,NA,Fiat Lux Freshman Seminars,ANTHRO 19,F,"Super passionate guy who is very into his research. However, the workload was a bit much for a one unit class (short assignments every week--on average takes 20 minutes and a 2 page paper due at the end of the quarter); nothing crazy, but still more than I expected from taking a fiat lux. He tends to talk AT the class for long periods of time rather than formatting it seminar-style. The name of the class, ""why am I crying over these kittens?"", is also a bit deceiving, it's really a class about an emotion being researched by him and his colleagues (think: the feeling you get watching military reunions, wedding proposals, cute animals, a particularly touching movie scene). Overall interesting topic and super nice professor but the class itself was unfortunately not interesting."
Alan Fiske,NA,Fiat Lux Freshman Seminars,ANTHRO 19,F,Very boring seminar. I would avoid taking  any future classes with this professor. Was a lot of work for a 2 unit class.
Alan Fiske,NA,Introduction to Psychological Anthropology: Current Topics and Research,ANTHRO 136B,A,Probably the best teacher I’ve had in the entire time I’ve been at UCLA. He made me fall in love with anthropology. The work is extremely easy and there is no essay for COVID classes. He is extremely caring and understanding. If I could rank all the professors professor Fiske is number one.
Alan Fiske,NA,Introduction to Psychological Anthropology: Current Topics and Research,ANTHRO 136B,B+," Selling course reader for $30-Like new, no highlights/markings. Also selling  ""Witchcraft, Oracles, and Magic Among the Azande""(the first required book) for $20.00 925-755-6630 (Text)"
Alan Fiske,NA,Introduction to Psychological Anthropology: Current Topics and Research,ANTHRO 136B,N/A," This professor was such a letdown. The readings were all old and boring; stuff most anthropology majors have seen a million times. The lectures didn't connect to the readings, and were extremely repetitive. The essay prompts were ridiculous. The TA's were inconsistent in their grading and Fiske had zero interest in the grading side of things.  Essentially, I felt like I worked my butt off for an A, but didn't learn anything new or worthwhile. I'm not sure if he's just been teaching for way too long or what. I'd avoid this class at all costs, it's a huge waste of time and money. "
Alan Fiske,NA,Introduction to Psychological Anthropology: Current Topics and Research,ANTHRO 136B,N/A,"Fiske is a boring, absent minded sloth... He says the essays are about having fun and learning, yet the experience is anything but! He has no intest in tending to the business of his underling students, and leaves them in the hands of power hungry, incompetent TAs, with no oversight. Avoid."
Alan Fiske,NA,Introduction to Psychological Anthropology: Current Topics and Research,ANTHRO 136B,N/A," I really wasnt impressed with Fiske. I was extremley interested in this class before i took it, but i found it to be extremely boring. He just presents random facts, that dont really tie into the readings. His paper topics are super broad, but he only gives you a small word limit to answer them in. A lot of people really felt like there was not enough room in the paper to get yourself an A. I was a psych major, and then switched to anthro, so I thought this would be an easy A. I got B's on the first two papers, and an A on the last one. And finally, for our final, Fiske agreed to give us a larger word limit, and I got an A+. Most people got a much higher grade on the final due to the longer length.  Overall, I really was disappointed with this class. I felt like the whole thing could have been summed up in a 1 hour discovery channel show and been much more interesting. There were to many random facts, with not enough theory or support to back them up. You MUST go to lecture to get an A (I got an A-). All of the papers demand you to incorporate points from lecture.  Make sure to get a good TA, section is 30% of your grade. My ta only graded on a -,+/-, or + scale, which made it impossible to gauge what your final grade would be. You will have to turn in ""questions"" on readings every week. Dont bother spending time to think of insightful questions, at least if you get W. Frankenhuis for your ta. The less ammount of time I spent on the questions, and the more simple they were, the better my grade. In summary: I'd take this class with another professor if you can. "
Alan Fiske,NA,Introduction to Psychological Anthropology: Current Topics and Research,ANTHRO 136B,N/A,"Reading materials are very interesting. His lectures is a supplement to the main reading though they do not really connect much with the essays assigned. Overall I enjoyed the class and learned a good deal of things. In terms of grading, it's really up to his TAs. Personally I found the class to be quite easy. "
Alan Fiske,NA,Introduction to Psychological Anthropology: Current Topics and Research,ANTHRO 136B,N/A," Papers are all 2 pages max, and the final was to edit one of those two-page papers and make it into a 3 page paper.  Make sure that you define all key terms you're using in your papers (like relational models or types of memory you are discussing) or you will lose big points (I made that mistake on my first paper).  The TAs are VERY hit-or-miss, and having a bad one will make section completely useless.   Fiske spends a lot of time rehashing his own experience with fieldwork and has one of those voices that it's hard to stay focused on, but the class, lecture, and readings are all actually really interesting.  Going to lecture is really important if you want to get something out of this class, and you absolutely need to understand memory systems, relational models, and the discussion of emotions for the papers.  All in all a very easy and interesting class."
Alan Fiske,NA,Introduction to Psychological Anthropology: Current Topics and Research,ANTHRO 136B,N/A,"Fiske is amazing. By far the best anthro professor I've had at UCLA. He doesn't use visual aids or anything, but quite often his classes were so interesting that I actually forgot to take notes. 135B was a very easy class (four essays, 2 pages each!) and my TA was great, but professor Fiske is a lecturer that I will never forget!"
Alan Fiske,NA,Introduction to Psychological Anthropology: Current Topics and Research,ANTHRO 136B,N/A,"take this class if: you are here to receive a great education (you'll get it with Fiske); psychology interests you; you're searching for a phenomenal professor who lectures well and tests fairlyYou will be blown away by the course material and the efficient, organized way in which it is presented...at least I was! Professor Fiske is a true scholar. do not take this class if: you are looking for a class you can slide by inFor this class to be truely worth it, I recommend you attend all the lectures and do as many of the readings as you can. Testing is all writing: 3 short papers and 1 longer paper (about 5 pages) so you won't do very well if you haven't heard Fiske's ideas or haven't done the reading."
Alan Fiske,NA,Introduction to Psychological Anthropology: Current Topics and Research,ANTHRO 136B,N/A,"This professor is great. His lecturs ar very straight foreward, he explains everything, will andswer all qestions, and really wants to teach. There are three 2 page essays and one 4 page final. Not difficult if you go to class and pay attention ( and 75% of the class went to every lecture) the class even clapped for him as he was walking out on the last day! There are suplementary ethnographies but the class is based on hs lectures so you must attend."
Alan Fiske,NA,Introduction to Psychological Anthropology: Current Topics and Research,ANTHRO 136B,N/A,"I took Anthro 135b with Professor Fiske and rarely have I ever regretted any decision more.  I'm not an anthro major, which may have been part of the problem.  But that class was so incredibly boring, I can't even begin to explain how boring it was.  In addition to which fact, lecture was at 8:30 in the morning!  So I could hardly stay awake!  The problem is that you need the lectures for the writing assignments.  The information from the lectures aren't in the readings (which, by the way, were horrible!).  You have to turn in weekly questions on the reading (probably because he knows you don't need the readings for the class), but you can just read isolated pages, a few from the end, and a few from the beginning and write questions on that.  Cause you just have to get them in, they don't actually count for anything.  And the discussion sections are the BIGGEST waste of time ever!  The only advantage to the class is that the 4 papers are only two pages each, and there's no exams.  So that makes it much easier.  But I would still recommend staying far far away from Fiske."
Alan Fiske,NA,Introduction to Psychological Anthropology: Current Topics and Research,ANTHRO 136B,N/A,"Professor Fiske covers quite a large cache of material in his course, so it's important to stay up to date on the lectures and readings.  The topics covered are fascinating, and lectures are always very engaging.  Sometimes tangents will pop up in the lectures, but they shouldn't affect overall performance.  There is *a lot* of reading and writing for this class; suffice it to say, A's are not guaranteed.  Professor Fiske also keeps a very lively course Web page, which is a valuable asset when it comes time to write a paper for the course.  Overall, I recommend this course and professor with enthusiasm."
Alan Fiske,NA,Introduction to Psychological Anthropology: Current Topics and Research,ANTHRO 136B,N/A,"Awesome class, awesome professor. You WILL work hard, and you WON'T get it all handed to you all tied up with a nice litte bow.  What you'll end up with is a lot of provacative information from someone who knows his stuff, and a chance to develop your own ideas.  Classes like this make me sorry we're on the quarter system."
Alan Fiske,NA,Field Methods in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 138P,A,"This class is a joke. You can learn everything in the class by just reading Bernard's book that he requires. The second book is useless and do not even buy it, you do not need it for the weekly assignments, discussions sections, or the final. The lectures as very dull, quiet, and unnecessary. He did not go over anything that was needed in the assignments, book, or the final. Over time, fewer and fewer people showed up, and I started to attend the lecture every other class. One day, there were only 20 of us, out of 150. There are weekly assignments, some require you to go out and do some fieldwork, which can be fun or intimidating. My TA was Eric and he was very helpful.  Those fieldwork assignments are 50 percent of your grade, and the final is like a bigger version of the assignments, which is 25 percent of your grade. There are strict guidelines, and if you follow them, you will end up with a grade you'd like.I would not recommend Fiske but I did learn a lot in this class."
Alan Fiske,NA,Field Methods in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 138P,A,"Lectures were mostly stories that vaguely helped you get an idea of problems that arise in field work, but otherwise they weren't very helpful. Prof's mic often cut out and even when it worked he mumbled a lot and was hard to hear/understand. He also went through the few slides which had new information too fast for me to take any notes. It felt really discouraging and unhelpful so most of the class stopped coming to lectures by midterms. The Bernard textbook has everything you need. TAs determined your grade. Pretty easy and kind of disappointing overall. The fieldwork assignments are what you make of them, though- if you want to try fieldwork, this is a (relatively) good free space to start from."
Megan Stephan,NA,Writing in English Major,ENGL 110T,A-,"DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT take this course at UCLA with Professor Stephan! She prides herself on making her class extremely difficult to receive an A in. If you check Bruinwalk, none of her ENGL 110T courses have students get an 'A'--just A-'s and a majority of B's. Her grading scale system is flawed as the highest percentage you can get on a homework assignment, yes homework assignment, is 95%. Right from the start, you lose 5% automatically. She does this so that everyone has a B or B+ going into the final paper which is 50% of your grade. She does not return to you a rubric or feedback on the paper just a final class grade on myucla, not even an actual grade for the paper. I took this course because the description described it as a workshop-based course for transfer students to sharpen their analytical skills--dear god was I wrong. Professor Stephan does not provide effective or even valid feedback. All of my assignments had few corrections for grammar and nothing else. You would expect a professor who decides to teach a workshop class would offer more feedback--she doesn't. She simply looks at your paper, reads it once, and comes to a conclusion of what you should get on the paper off the top of her head. She treated us transfer students as second-class students at UCLA. She gave us an entire talk about don't expect an A in this course, even though you're used to getting A's back in community college. As if our community college academia is nothing compared to UCLA. I can proudly say I learned the most about my writing and how to improve it at Community college. Professor Stephan should not be the professor to teach this course at all as she lacks the compassion and guidance to help students succeed.  Because this course failed in what it sought out to do for students, I would highly recommend to elsewhere or take a different course instead of enrolling in ENGL 110T."
Megan Stephan,NA,Writing in English Major,ENGL 110T,B+,"I left this class feeling more confused as to what is expected for ""improved"" writing. Her assignments were on a  check/ plus check basis and I must say it does not prepare you as a writer/ is not at all supplemental for your overall grade as the final is worth 50%. I was excited for this workshop class but it seems this professor flexes on hardly anyone finishing with an A. She never kept an online grade book on myUCLA or CCLE and was bothered when students emailed to ask to see their grades, often failing to answer them at all.  I would avoid this instructor at all costs and I would not* take her again. I feel less confident and more shame in writing than when I started."
Megan Stephan,NA,Writing in English Major,ENGL 110T,A-,"Professor Stephan goes out of her way to choose interesting readings for this class. She even goes out of her way to incorporate new materials (she incorporated Amanda Gorman's inauguration poem, which was very cool) You never feel like you are doing busy work in this class, each reading is meaningful. English 100T is filled with interesting discussions as a class. The atmosphere is always passionate, respectful, and welcoming. I've taken multiple classes with Professor Stephan and I have found her to be flexible, understanding, and empathetic. I recommend her highly!"
Megan Stephan,NA,Writing in English Major,ENGL 110T,B+,This Professor knows her stuff. This class had engaging material and covered a substantial amount of information on how to spruce up your writing. The grading system is a bit confusing but it is meant for the student to focus on improvement rather than points or percentages. What I really enjoyed about this class was the fruitful discussions that would take place after the readings. The Professor is generous with her office hours so take advantage of them for any clarity you might need.
Megan Stephan,NA,British Popular Literature,ENGL 115B,A," Professor Stephan was really engaging and had interesting lectures on Gothic Literature. She brought in very good secondary literary criticism, provided resources for essay writing & a ton of extra readings for us to have a better understanding of the vampire movement.  Tougher grader though, so attend office hours and make sure you know what her writing pet peeves are."
Paul V Kroskrity,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"This is the first anthro I've taken at UCLA. I'm an Anthro BS (premed) and have completed 2 years of premed classes coming into this class. Lets just say I had to turn the right side of my brain on for the first time since high school! The class has a lot of reading, something I'm not used to in science classes, but to say the least I did roughly half of the reading and had no problem on his tests. The tests are multiple choice, and if you've gone to lecture and taken really good notes you can get almost everything. The class has a few underlying themes (language in context vs. language in text), and if you figure them out, the questions all fall into place; skip lecture and your screwed, b/c the readings are too complicated to get out the info needed to succeed. The projects for the class aren't bad, and if you just complete what's asked, you're already at a B+. Prof. Kroskrity curves at an A-; that's right! Be above average and you have an A. I got an A+ and I wasn't even the high score on the midterm. I was totally freaked out coming into his tests b/c the material is so vague, but hang in there and if you understand lecture, you're golden."
Paul V Kroskrity,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"Before I say anything I will say do not take this course with this prof during the summer, you will regret it.  There are a ton of readings and they are very complicated, I am an anthro upper div. major and interested, and I still had a really tough time in the weeks alloted to get through and make it out.  Kroskrity and his absolutely dreadful way of lecture (I started to realize I was noticing and JOTTING DOWN the ""ah, um, aaaaah"", yes, all in one sentence and about everyother sentence, sequences in his broken speech he was belting out every 20 seconds or so more than what he was talking about.  For a linguist he sure has a hard time speaking clearly and to the point.)  only makes you go even more insane.  Out of the ocean of material you have to go through he gives lectures on powerpoint that are, truthfully, three to four sentences long and really make very little sense.  When asked, as he was a few times at the begining, to clarify something he would abruptly and somewhat gruffly tell them to read the text (despite I and others who talked about it later had read the text and had the same questions).  He did not answer any questions in this regard, not one.  He is not helpful.  So, with the huge and complex articles and the three to four sentence explanations you are given a test that is extremely detail specific and often seemed to come from some abstract part of the text or some brief, momentary mention of an example he gave.  There is of course no review for exams and with all the readings it is daunting to try and take it all in for a test.    His tangents, as others described go on and on and seem to have little to do with the material and are done, as is the explanation of the little he does go over, in such a way that one would think he was giving the lecture to a linguistics graduate class.  There were terms upon terms, concepts and ideas, that I had not the slighest notion of and during a regular quarter it may have been possible to research but during a five week course???  He doesn't seem to understand that this is a GE undergrad course.  He himself, as is indicitive of his speach, and the multitude of errors on the powerpoint and sylbs seems like a disorganized and sometimes confused guy.  He does seem very nice but I gotta say I have never been this frustrated with a professor and class before.  All things being equal look at his rating percentage...take this course from Duranti or anyone else during the regular year.  You will save yourself a huge headache."
Paul V Kroskrity,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,Do not take this class if you're not an anthro major. I took this class and dropped it. It was the first time I dropped a class so hopefully you'll get the point. The lectures were really boring. The readings were not only hard to understand but also too much for a summer class. The assignments were sooo vague and time consuming. I wanted to take this class as a GE but ended up spending more time on this class rather than my upper division major class. Stay away from this class.
Paul V Kroskrity,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"He uses an old projector which can be hard to read. BUT, he is sincerely a nice guy and it comes through during the lectures and the overall structure of the class. He is also genuinely interested in subject matter and it comes through in lectures. He's not really an entertaining lecturer-- no flashy powerpoint presentations-- he'll crack an occasional joke or anecdote from the field but when it comes down to it it's clear this guy knows his stuff. He has fair grading policies and the courseload is decent. Take his class."
Paul V Kroskrity,NA,Fiat Lux Freshman Seminars,ANTHRO 19,F,"Loved this fiat lux, great space to meet other students intimately during online learning, Professor Kroskrity asked insightful questions and gave space for great discussion."

Paul V Kroskrity,NA,Native American Languages and Cultures,ANTHRO C144,N/A,this class made me want to drop out of college -10/10 do not recommend
Paul V Kroskrity,NA,Native American Languages and Cultures,ANTHRO C144,N/A,Professor Kroskrity is an excellent and engaging lecturer. His lectures apart from being full of interesting information and insight about the reading material and authors are often very funny. You must go to lectures not only because they make the readings easy to understand and it makes the exams straightforward but because he shares anecdotes and cool background that make the material you read easy to remember and enjoyable to learn. His exams and take home exam are extremely fair to anyone who is paying attention to lecture and doing the reading. He is a funny and very kind guy who is really excited and passionate about the material and it makes it easy for you to enjoy it too. 
Paul V Kroskrity,NA,Native American Languages and Cultures,ANTHRO C144,N/A," Prof Kroskrity was an AMAZING professor! At first, I wasn't sure what to expect. I didn't have much knowledge about Native Americans but after this course I have a HUGE interest in Linguistic Anthropology. As a Ling major, this class wasn't required but definitely got my attention about Lang Ideology. Prof Kroskrity isn't the best lecturer but he is the real deal. He doesn't try to be an uptight professor, just someone who is passionate about what he does- teach and research. Yea he goes off on tangent and stories but they are relevant to the what his field of work is all about.  I have a different attitude now about Native Americans, so in my opinion, he did his job! He got me and other students to understand and appreciate the simple things- language and culture- whether it is our own or someone elses. He is very easy to talk to- I highly recommend him if you can stand a little monotany."
Paul V Kroskrity,NA,Native American Languages and Cultures,ANTHRO C144,N/A,I found this class very stressful and difficult. Several students scored a 19 or 20 out of a possible 67 points on the take-home midterm. After the terrible midterm a huge percentage of the class dropped. I was able to get an 'A' in the class but I am not quite sure how I did it.  Kroskrity certainly knows a lot about Native American culture and languages but I am not impressed by his teaching style.  Take this class at your own risk.
Paul V Kroskrity,NA,Native American Languages and Cultures,ANTHRO C144,N/A,"Nice professor, but as all the other reviews said, he is very very boring. I usually brought a crossword puzzle or something to read with me to lecture. But the topics are very interesting and he is very into the topic of Native American linguistics. (He has a tendency to make weird jokes about it too, which are kinda funny in his own way...) His exams are VERY fair. Take home midterm and take home final and straightforward questions. Make sure you answer every question and try to cite from as many readings as possible."
Paul V Kroskrity,NA,Native American Languages and Cultures,ANTHRO C144,N/A,"Professor Kroskrity IS a bit monotone, but he's a nice professor, makes himself available during office hours, and has very interesting research. His classes usually consist of an outline, which he then lectures off of. My class was graded on two papers and the grading was fair."
Paul V Kroskrity,NA,Native American Languages and Their Speakers,ANTHRO 155,A,"If you're thinking about taking this class, do it! Prof. Kroskrity is amazing and he genuinely cares about his students doing well. There are quite a bit of readings and the essays are long, but he will walk you through it if you need it. He let us submit outlines before the essays were due and rewrite certain portions after we got our grade to get points back. His feedback is SO helpful and he's just so nice with his time when it comes to students. An A is very doable, as long as you put some time into the readings/essays."
Paul V Kroskrity,NA,Native American Languages and Their Speakers,ANTHRO 155,A,"Prof. Kroskrity is a great professor! While I'm not going to lie, the readings for the class were quite long and not really interesting, Prof. Kroskrity was very open to answering any and all questions for the class. He mentioned that he used to give quizzes on the readings, but due to everything being online, our grades were based on two things, a midterm and final essay, each being worth half of our grade. He is a tricky grader, but he allows a rewrite for the midterm to earn half of the missed points back. I'm sure it varies by quarter, but he did lower the percentage needed for an A+, A, A-, and so on by a couple percent. His grading on the midterm should give a clear idea of what is needed for the final, so there is no reason not to do well. He also allows optional outlines to be submitted to him before each essay is due to make sure you're on the right track, I definitely recommend doing this! He posts lectures online and uses the designated class time as an office hours instead. Overall, while the course load may seem like a lot and might not be entirely interesting, I don’t think getting the A should be hard. Just a little time consuming in terms of reading and writing 8-9 page papers (he does give us 2-3 weeks to write each though)."
Paul V Kroskrity,NA,Native American Languages and Their Speakers,ANTHRO 155,A,"This was a really tough class. Professor Kroskrity is really kind and the material can be interesting, but the expectations and requirements are just too much. There was an insane amount of reading that felt physically impossible to complete while taking other classes, and the exams really required you to remember every single reading and his thoughts on them. I will say he goes over the readings in lecture emphasizing the important points, but it's still too much. His lectures are also very rambly. The papers are most of your grade, and they are graded harshly, and they aren't even papers, just regurgitations of the knowledge he expects you to pick up from him. If you know this ahead of time hopefully you won't waste as much time as I did crafting an essay when it was more of a written exam. He does let you revise your midterm and offered an extra credit assignment that was interesting. I ended up doing well in this class but it was only with a LOT of blood, sweat, and tears during Finals week. If you have another option for linguistic anthropology I would take it, but as long as you know what you are getting yourself into, this class isn't completely awful."
Paul V Kroskrity,NA,Native American Languages and Their Speakers,ANTHRO 155,A-,"This class was a lot of work because of the sheer amount of reading one must do to get an understanding of the material. However, it is well worth it as I learned so much in the class! It is not an easy class but Kroskrity is a good and engaging professor, and truly a top level guy in the field of anthropology. I highly recommend him!"
Susan Slyomovics,NA,Global Islam,CLUSTER 27A,A," I am going to keep it real with all of you, there is not one person who I know that took this class and loved it. For all of my LS majors, I am still deciding whether this class is worth the extra GE credits. For other humanities majors I advise against taking this class unless you're really into learning about Islam.   I believe this class has potential but right now it is a little bit of a boring, confusing mess. The faculty involved in Global Islam are all very understanding and are really good at getting back to you. However, I found a lot of their instruction as vague. You are required to do about 3 hours of reading a week which is not fun because they are long and dense, but you have to read them and pay attention in class because you never know what will be asked on the weekly quizzes. The topic is very broad and although the professors try to centralize on the 4 ""big themes"", a lot of the information is random  and doesn't exactly follow a pattern. Although I do like the professors as people, they somehow make the topic extremely boring. The research and writing specialists are nice, but are also not very helpful with the assignments.  The grading structure is based on 6 things. Attendance 10%, Participation 10%, Weekly Quizzes 20%, Response Paper 25%, Final Paper 20%, CoCurricular Activity 5%.  The lowest quiz grade is dropped. There are 4 prompts for the response papers, you only have to do 3 of them, 500-600 words each. Final paper, 5-6 pages max, is broken down into 5  sections including related questions, articles, thesis and outline, revised thesis and outline, and final draft. I had a really difficult time figuring out what the paper needed. The directions and rubric were unclear and vague. The cocurricular is just a 2-3 hr activity you do outside of class and you have to write a 2 page response on it. The key to doing well in this class is building a good relationship with you TA, doing all the assignments, and participating in discussion. Your TA is your grader for everything so questions or details on assignments should be reviewed by them.  It is not inherently a difficult class, it is just a lot of work and it is not very fun. I do appreciate that faculty and staff are all a really nice and passionate about what they do but the structure and clarity needs a lot of work. Just prepare your friends and roommates for complaining about how much you dislike the class. I hope this helps."
Susan Slyomovics,NA,Global Islam,CLUSTER 27A,A,"Professor Slyomovics is painstakingly boring and her portion of the lectures were tough to get through. The other lecturers, however, I quite enjoyed, especially Professor Yarbrough. The content is interesting but goes into great detail. There is a LOT of reading assigned every week and a weekly timed quiz in discussion. But, other than that, not too many actual assignments (3 short essays + the final). Not my favorite class by any means but definitely an eye-opener! The co-curricular is cool."
Susan Slyomovics,NA,Global Islam,CLUSTER 27A,A+," I absolutely loved the Global Islam Cluster and Professor Slyomovics! We learned about Islam from a wide variety of disciplines and perspectives, and it was incredibly eye-opening and fulfilling to finally take a class without a highly Eurocentric curriculum (a big change from typical high school classes). I honestly looked forward to attending every lecture, even with the many pains and annoyances of Zoom University. Each lecture was so engaging and informational -- the professors in this cluster really pushed us to think critically and with an open mind. Professor Slyomovics is a super cool person and her research/life experiences are pretty insane (she did human rights work in Morocco during the truth commission).  The workload was a bit heavy at times with all the readings (though I found each reading to be extremely interesting), but the instructors were always super accommodating and listened to student feedback about lessening the workload/moving deadlines. Though this class is centered around the theme of Global Islam, everything I've learned is applicable to so many other aspects of my life; I'm extremely grateful to have gotten the ability to take this course!"
Susan Slyomovics,NA,Global Islam,CLUSTER 27A,A+,"Highly recommend this class. I took it the first quarter it was offered and even completely virtual the class was super engaging and interesting. Since it's a cluster you spend a year focusing on Islam from a variety of different perspectives from some of the most knowledgeable and amazing professors on campus, and I have to say it has definitely changed the way I think about the social sciences. As a STEM major, like many others I took this class because it satisfied a lot of my GEs, but I got way more out of this class than that.To start with, the papers that I've written in this class have been some of the most interesting and unexpected, and I've been able to learn analytical skills both within and outside the social sciences that I don't think I would've learned outside this cluster and that I'll probably continue to apply beyond this class. The professors are so approachable and are always willing to help with research for your papers or your understanding of a topic.The third quarter of the cluster is also organized into small seminars where you delve into a subtopic with a small group of students and a TA (there are multiple seminars, each on a different topic, which you can chose from). I've had some of the most interesting discussions there and the small class size (it was about 10ish people) made the class way more engaging than your typical GEs. There was also a lot of focus on connections with present day issues, which also made the seminar an awesome opportunity to become more informed and aware of how the subject (and the social sciences more broadly) intersects with contemporary environmentalism, politics, science, etc., and learn things I can take with me beyond this class.There is a bit of work and reading that comes with the class, but if you stick with it it will be worth it, and you'll be proud of the diversity of what you've learned and of the work that you've produced. It's not the easiest class you'll find, but in a way the challenge made it worth it :D"
Susan Slyomovics,NA,Thousand and One Nights/Alf Layla Wa-Layla,COM LIT M110,A+,"Very interesting content, but the professor is what ruined it for me. Over five different students in the class that I've talked to have complained about the teacher being extremely rude to them. I had this same experience. Lesson is : don't bother asking her for help. It's unfortunate because she seems like the nicest lady but really doesn't seem to care about her students' success. In terms of workload, there are 4 five page essays due every other week and then one 10 minute oral presentation. Not terrible, but the essays are pretty hard and the TA grades harshly without much feedback. Overall, I don't recommend taking this course."
Susan Slyomovics,NA,Thousand and One Nights/Alf Layla Wa-Layla,ARABIC M110,N/A,"Interesting content, workload isn't terrible if you time manage well(4 five page essays and one oral presentation), ta is kinda a harsh grader but what really ruined it for me was the professor. one tip = DO NOT ask her for help on ANYTHING"
Susan Slyomovics,NA,Thousand and One Nights/Alf Layla Wa-Layla,ARABIC M110,A,"Very interesting class, Professor Slyomovics is very knowledgeable about the subject matter and I learned a lot from her. She is not good at all with computers though and will definitely need someone to help her most lectures. The grader, Professor Farley, is a really cool, great guy. His lecture was very enjoyable and interesting.  Grading breakdown: 20% oral presentation, 30% midterm, 50% final. The part that scares everyone the most is the oral presentation - It is just a retelling of the part of 1001 Nights that was assigned for the lecture. She randomly picks people every time. This isn't lecture and the stories are easy reads so just do your reading and you should be fine. You aren't really graded on quality of storytelling, just don't go up there and say you don't know it. The papers are doable, they are just two and a half page essays that you can pick the prompt for. 4 essays for the midterm and 6 for the final. Also she doesn't use slides so just write down what's on the board and all the discussion in class to help with the essays."
Susan Slyomovics,NA,Visual Anthropology: Documentary Photography,ANTHRO 135,A+,"It was a pretty easy class if you're a good writer. Slyomovics may come off as sometimes unapproachable but she's actually very concerned about her student's learning, and is very smart. The reading is pretty heavy, but the way her exams are structured, you can choose which readings you want to focus on, so you can skim other readings.  I believe she is a great professor, and even though I didn't necessarily find the material interesting at first, I was engaged in her lectures because she is a good lecturer. I would definitely suggest taking this class, either if you want to learn more about visual anthropology, or if you're looking for a class that isn't too difficult."
Susan Slyomovics,NA,Visual Anthropology: Documentary Photography,ANTHRO 135,A,"If you want to waste a quarter at UCLA, do not take this class. The professor assigns both the final paper and a final exam in the same week. The class is absolutely not worth it and you leave class feeling as though you learned absolutely nothing. Waste of a class."
Susan Slyomovics,NA,Visual Anthropology: Documentary Photography,ANTHRO 135,F," I mean this so sincerely: run away. This class was so unnecessarily the difficult. The TA (bless his heart) was helpful, kind, and understanding, but the professor left much to be desired. First, she sets unclear and unrealistic expectations. The first assignment was to analyze a photograph, but we were not allowed to choose a picture somebody else had already chosen-- and we weren't allowed to coordinate amongst ourselves and ensure we were all working on different pictures. A duplicate image was docked 10 points for an assignment worth 15. To not allow any kind of coordination between the students before they put in the time and work on an assignment that they may ultimately have to redo is ridiculous. Second, her guidelines are unclear, even to the TA. Like I said, no hate to the TA, he was great, but her feedback and answers on certain things would directly contradict his. So either she was not communicating how she should, or he was just as confused as us. Third, communicating with her outside of class feels like an impossible task. She will ignore parts of your emails and will forget that you have already covered something with her in an earlier email-- even if it is within the same thread. She also assumes that you have not read any part of the syllabus, attended any class, or have reviewed any assignment before reaching out to her. That being said, fourth, she is incredibly condescending. She has repeatedly mentioned to us in our /mandated office visit/ that we are not anthropologists and our ideas for our projects (which often fall in direct line with her lecture material) are unfounded. She expects the worst in you, and definitely makes that clear in how she communicates with you.  Last, her take-home test clocked out at a minimum of 4000 words and took the class at least 8+ hours to finish, there are way too many readings required for each class, and the final project is daunting. There is not a whole lot that you are graded on, but what you are graded on is exhaustingly difficult. If none of these things matter to you, or you've had worse, then the class itself can definitely be interesting. It feels more like a history of photography class than a visual anthropology class, but there is something very cool about the former and you will for sure learn some new stuff. And if you have a project idea that prof loves, you'll enjoy the final project. But, if you can't stand being talked down to, being told one thing by the TA and another by the prof, or her constant contradicting herself, then I would opt for literally any other anthro class that will be more in line with anthropological perspective on, literally, anything."
Susan Slyomovics,NA,Visual Anthropology: Documentary Photography,ANTHRO 135,F," Lovely professor. She is very sweet, thoughtful, and helpful. Very smart. Answers emails quickly!   However, I found it a bit hard to hear her during lecture (the mic would go in and out). I found the lectures to be a little bit boring. Maybe if you really like photography and the history behind photos and styles of photos and the context, you would find the class to be more interesting. I didn't care for the subject matter but I guess it depends on the person.  The class has a very light workload and your whole grade is basically based off of 1-2 assignments, a big final photography paper, and a take home exam. Easy A. I appreciated the format of the class and was allowed to be creative which was fun!"
Susan Slyomovics,NA,Visual Anthropology: Documentary Photography,ANTHRO 135,N/A," The class was fascinating. I learned quite a bit about the field of visual anthropology and the history of photography. Slyomovics gives you a lot of freedom to engage with the readings and coursework and express your ideas through all of her assignments. She allows creativity and doesn't force students into any real prescribed formats for her class. She is, however, a stickler for correct grammar, spelling, and citations. Plan ahead to attend her office hours, even if you are like me and had to skip part of another class to do so. It will save you time at the end of the quarter. We ended up waiting in an hour long line to get her to sign off on our project proposals (mandatory). BTW, get your proposal signed during office hours ahead of time to save yourself the headache. Slyomovics arranges her class throughout the quarter by themes and this helps to see broader contexts. All of the readings and websites and suggested field trips are useful for the exams and papers. If you are a lazy ass, you will most likely still get an OK grade, but if you actually care about learning and put some effort into the class and the materials, you will gain a ton of valuable knowledge... Its one of those classes where its totally up to you.  "
Susan Slyomovics,NA,Visual Anthropology: Documentary Photography,ANTHRO 135,N/A,"First thing is first, this class should be an easy A for anyone. I pulled of a 98% on the midterm and studied for a few hours. Around 75% of people get an A in the class. That said you should not take this class. One literally learns nothing in that class. I’ve walked out of the class every day, wondering what I just learned. I was panic stricken for the midterm, because I felt I hadn’t learned anything. Well it wasn’t me, the concepts on the midterm where elementary and if you just could memorize some random photos anyone could pass the midterm, regardless of taking the class or not. The “project” is also a joke. Its five pages long, you take photos relate your project to some reading and that’s it. Then there is the “professor.” She loves to micromanage, instead of giving you a list of approved topics she has you come up with one, only to reject it or complain about your project for some minor little thing about it. She wants you to come to her office hours, to discuss the project in fact it’s required. However, when you do show up she makes sure you know you are wasting her time. Inside of her office and in the classroom she is rude, condescending, and loves to put students down. Like I said the class if an easy A, if your reading this you probably would get an A in the class, but if you don’t want to take a class that is a complete joke and waste of time, with a “professor” who is high on herself, you should avoid this class.  "
Karen Brodkin,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"During much of this class I was confused and frustrated by the way lecture material was presented.  In the end however, everything came together and I learned more than in most GE classes because of the way I was forced to synthesize the material.  If you stick with the lectures and keep up with the reading you can get a lot out of this class.  As others have mentioned, the TA is very important to your grade.  Anjali was great."
Karen Brodkin,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"GOD she's the most preachy professor ever.  She's one of those people that is so liberal that she needs to spread it around.  I got an A in this class, but i want all of those hours i sat in lecture listening to her crazy rantings back.  I'm a liberal myself, but i keep my opinions to myself.  She didn't teach anything so don't take this class for it's substance.  Most of the class either didn't show up or fell asleep. Someone really needs to tell this woman to sell her crazy some where else."
Karen Brodkin,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"very interesting with an ability to look at the world from a different perspective.  highly caring, do stop by her office hours, even if only to chat.  do the reading, take notes when necessary, and class should be good.  grading depends more on ta than professor, so bond more with the ta"
Karen Brodkin,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A," Overall, this prof is alright. She did spend a good deal of time time touting her political views, but her lectures were mildly interesting. The TA's grade everything, so getting a good one is more important than the professor. Our midterm had questions that were given to us in advance, and our final was take-home essays. Aside from that, we had two really short, really easy papers.  Aside from that, we read a few ethnographies and the textbook was pretty much only used for definitions.  I'd recommend this class if you're looking for an easy grade, but if you're serious about the subject material, this might not be the best class to give you an overview."
Karen Brodkin,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,Prfessor Brodkin was VERY enlightening and helpful. The grade that you get in this class really depends on what kind of T.A's you have. (Anjali) was a great T.A. She knew the material well and was very helpful. I recommend this class to people even if it's just to fulfill a G.E. req.
Karen Brodkin,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,Professor Brodkin was great. She was really concerned that students learned the material.  You have to write 2 research papers which are pretty lenient and the midterm questions are given to you ahead of time so that you do well.  I really recommend this class because it's interesting.
Nancy E Levine,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"Professor Levine made Anthro 9 a good class.  She responds to questions during lecture and loves to answer email and questions posted on the course website.  Although some of the material can be dry, she does her best to make it light and engaging.  She scheduled office hours right before the midterm to deal w/ any last minute questions/concerns.  Furthermore, Professor Levine answered emails until   9pm the night before the final.  Her exams are multiple choice, short answer and/or short essay.  They are not overly easy or hard, but if you come to lecture and read the ethnographies, you can't go wrong."
Nancy E Levine,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A," In my opinion, Prof Levine is one of the best Anthropology professors I've had.  Her lectures may go fast for most people, but there's a lot of material to cover in a general survery of human society!  She's engaging with the class, answers questions without being condescending, and is generally quick about answering questions posted to the discussion board. The bottom line is, to get an A and a worthwhile experience, take her for Anthro 9, do the reading, attend discussion, and most importantly, pay attention. P.S. For the more controversial topics in the class, such as Napoleon Chagnon and Patrick McTierney (Darkness at El Dorado), read some of the statements made by Chagnon on his website at UC Santa Barbara to get a fulller picture.  Don't rely solely on what comes up in discussion."
Nancy E Levine,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"Prof. Levine was a wonderful teacher.  I had her the first quarter of my freshman year for Anthro 9 and she's definately the best professor I've had so far.  I was in her honors discussion section which was really helpful and not that difficult at all.  She's really concerned with student learning, and her exams were very easy and very fair.  Just study your lecture notes and read the case studies.  You don't have to every little detail, she just expects you to understand the broad themes of the class.  I got an A and I didn't even go to all the lectures or discussions, and I didn't have to study that much either.  I definately reccomend Anthro 9 with Levine."
Nancy E Levine,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,She is a monster!...she doesn't know what she's talking about....and she's really boring in lecture.....i consider myself a very good student in high school and have never fallen asleep in any of my classes.....but things changed when i went in her class....and if i fall asleep in her class....and i think i'm a very conscientous student...what makes you think you can stay awake....i'm so serious.....the material is good reading...and take it if you like anthro.....but don't take it if you want a good professor....cuz i promise you...she won't give you the time of day and she'll give you bad info's that will bring down your grade......she needs to go back to lebanon or wherever she did her damn research from and preach to those people there....at least they would have a chance to tell her she's a bad professor because they're not getting graded by her....
Nancy E Levine,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"I thought Prof. Levine was okay. She was a little boring at times and her lecture style definitely made it hard to stay up even at 10 AM. But the topics she talked about were very interesting and for that, the class is worth taking. Everything in her class was pretty straight forward, the grading for Anthro 9 depends more on the TAs than her."
Nancy E Levine,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,Her lectures are usually pretty interesting and always very well organized. A very good 'sit-back-and-learn' class. It just takes occasional reading and two essays and you're done - painless!
Nancy E Levine,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"If your an independant learner (you sit in the back, occasionally do the assigned reading) and go to most of the lectures, you should do fine in this class...I never really talked to Prof Levine personally, but I appreciated her organized lectures, (when I had my cup of coffee). She posted all the info you needed to know for the test on the website. A tolerable way to get rid of a GE but not the most interesting."
Nancy E Levine,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A," From my personal experience, Dr. Levine is very helpful. Why? 1) She responded to email and the discussion board the night before the final and midterm. 2) When I visited her during office hours, she spent plenty of time answering any and all questions-and then some, which truly helped me answer questions on the exams. 3) I never felt rushed when I asked her any questions, either after class or during office hours. 4) She answered all my questions during lecture. Others would also raise their hands and she didn't belittle them, from my experience. Anyhow, please make your decision for yourself. If you were to ask me, I would highly recommend her, for the reasons stated above."
Nancy E Levine,NA,Multispecies Anthropology,ANTHRO C144M,A,I feel that this professor could take an interesting subject and wring the joy of learning about it out so that I wish I had known about her through a Bruin Walk review and avoided her at all costs. It was wretched. Let the student beware.
Nancy E Levine,NA,"Marriage, Family, and Kinship",ANTHRO M145P,A-,"Basically didn't have any assignments besides the midterm, final paper, and final. The midterm and final were short essay/response format but some questions were definitely harder than others, also open book and note. She gives exam preview questions and gives you feedback on what she wants (no extra credit tho); I turned in the wrong response but she was fairly understanding and let me turn it in late. Overall fairly easy class, but the few assignments can make getting a higher grade hard."
Nancy E Levine,NA,"Marriage, Family, and Kinship",ANTHRO M145P,A,Avoid this teacher at all cost. They have lost a passion for teaching and are only in the position to reinforce a need of superiority over students who are trying to learn new material. Worst professor I've experienced on the UCLA campus.
Nancy E Levine,NA,"Marriage, Family, and Kinship",ANTHRO M145P,A,"Professor Levine is generally a good lecturer and she is knowledgable on the topic because she has done research on kinship and marriage throughout her career.  Her lectures aren't SUPER interesting but at the same time I never fell asleep so.... She is a pretty easy grader on the ""reading response"" assignments (4 total, 1 is optional), BUT her TAs are NOT easy graders at all and they are the ones who grade the midterm and final.  In my class, people were averaging very high on assignment but the average for the midterm was a 78.  She mentioned the possibility of a curve but I have yet to see it.  She is not very tech savvy so the bruincast was often malfunctioning but I came to class so it didn't really affect me.  She also couldn't really figure out sound on videos but just help her out tbh.Despite this, the class was not too bad and I'd take it again."
Nancy E Levine,NA,"Marriage, Family, and Kinship",ANTHRO M145P,B+,"It is obvious the Professor Levine knows what she is talking about and can be very engaging, but if you take this class be prepared for the workload and difficult tests. The midterm can be like a slap in the face. Recommend this class but only to those who can handle it."
Nancy E Levine,NA,"Marriage, Family, and Kinship",ANTHRO M145P,N/A,"I understand this condescending tone of which previous students speak.  She certainly will not use this demeanor in the middle of a large lecture, and she certainly will not brandish this intellectual elitism if you are speaking to her about her travels or her interests, which I am sure she is quite happy to have someone listen to her talk about, but one does get the sense that unless you present yourself as very agreeable to everything she says, she can be rather rude.  I have met many professional intellectuals who did not feel the need to be rude during a one-sided conversation that they themselves controlled.  Prof. Levine does not like to be inconvenienced with matters that she regards as not worth her time.  This of course is not a crime. Nor is being boring in lecture or neurotic in real life a crime.  However, I find rudeness in a civilized atmosphere where both parties have already acknowledged there is an imbalance of power (the almighty professor speaking to a lowly student) a bewildering way to communicate.  The class was run-of-the-mill in terms of difficulty, so I was able to achieve a good grade with some dedicated reading.  I simply am weary when I am in the presence of men or women who do not like to be ""opposed."" "
Nancy E Levine,NA,"Marriage, Family, and Kinship",ANTHRO M145P,N/A," Her lectures are very straightforward. For the first half of the class she has her lectures on the powerpoint then she just lectures orally. We had to watch at least four movies, pay attention to those as there will be questions on the exams. She is really nice and sweet and gives a lenient curve after the midterm and final. Class itinerary MidtermPaperFinal The paper isn't difficult to write, the tests will draw upon the readings so be sure to read them! She will skim over them in lecture but it is your job to keep track. The readings aren't difficult or dense. Other than that a decent class!"
Nancy E Levine,NA,"Marriage, Family, and Kinship",ANTHRO M145P,N/A,"All in all, a Mickey Mouse course in terms of difficulty. Study guides prep you for the exam but taking notes doesn't hurt. Doing all the course reader readings is not necessary, if you read one or so from each topic, u'll get the idea. To sum up the course: A midterm, a final, and an easy paper. Lectures are indeed quite boring, as is the topic as such, but nonetheless, do take! Your transcript will thank you..."
Nancy E Levine,NA,"Marriage, Family, and Kinship",ANTHRO M145P,N/A,Her tests are extremely difficult. The lectures are extremely boring and redundant yet she does emphasize what is in the reading in her lectures.  You must do all the readings in order to be successful in the course. She is a hard grader but has a lenient curve. I wouldn't take this class again.
Nancy E Levine,NA,"Marriage, Family, and Kinship",ANTHRO M145P,N/A,"Great teacher, great class.  Her exams are very fair as long as you learn her lectures(which are short and easily understood) and the case studies in the assigned reading.  You don't have to do the rest of the reading unless you want to get more out of the class.  She taught this course with another prof and her half of the exams was always fair.  She cares for her students and it is a relaxed atmostphere in her classroom.  The material in the class is easily understood and you will not regret taking it with Levine.  I got an A in the class."
Nancy E Levine,NA,Societies of Central Asia,ANTHRO 163Q,A," I took this in Winter 21 so covid time. She recorded and posted a lecture for Tuesdays, and then on Thursdays we met live for a QnA, work on our group projects, and project presentations. The guidelines for the group project are incredibly vague, but she grades easy. We had a midterm and a final, both with about 4 questions, and 5 quizzes throughout the quarter of about 6 questions each. The quizzes were really easy. For the midterm and final, she released a question about 3-4 days early so we can work on it and it had the same due date as the rest of the exam. So in the 1.5 hours we had for the exam, we were only answering 3 questions. The MT and final were graded by the TA and he was pretty lenient. All of it was open note and open book. The readings are a LOT, I'm talking a few weeks we had over 100 pages total. Most students didn't even read half of it. It was interesting but really dense and professor Levine doesn't really go over it too well in the lecture. The TA went over it more in depth but there's only so much you can go over in 50 minutes. Overall, I think this is a pretty easy class to do well in if you really take advantage of posted resources, but it is a time consuming class."
Nancy E Levine,NA,Societies of Central Asia,ANTHRO 163Q,A,"The material for this class is very interesting, but her voice made me sleepy during lectures so drink coffee. She has a lot of knowledge about many societies in Central Asia, but she lacks empathy for students during these difficult times."
Nancy E Levine,NA,Societies of Central Asia,ANTHRO 163Q,B+,"The course material was very engaging but she is a tough grader. I took this class remotely online during the Covid outbreak. She had no midterm or final but she assigned weekly readings which consisted of 500 word count essays. She also assigns lots of readings (anywhere between 40-90 pages a week, give or take). The weekly writings made up your overall final grade and she graded them with scrutiny! What was challenging in the weekly writing was she prompted you to cover a lot of material in those writings, but with a limited word count. In other words, there was no room to use examples or sources to back up your argument. I did all the readings, assignments, and I showed up to every lecture and I still got B+. If you're really intrigued by Central Asian studies then take this class. But if you're looking for a upper div course to fill, maybe consider other options"
Nancy E Levine,NA,Societies of Central Asia,ANTHRO 163Q,A,This professor is one of the worst I have experienced on the UCLA campus. She needs to retire as her passion for teaching has dwindled.
Nancy E Levine,NA,Societies of Central Asia,ANTHRO 163Q,N/A," Pros:*Very intelligent, answers questions really well*Tests are usually straightforward*Has few extraneous assignments*Gives good, interesting, relevant readings*Podcasts, but it's worth going to lecture Cons:*Pretty monotonous*Tests can be surprisingly difficult Overall, she's a good professor. It's not too difficult to get a good grade. She's not very rigorous. The tests are usually multiple choice. I've taken two classes with her."
Nancy E Levine,NA,Societies of Central Asia,ANTHRO 163Q,N/A,"I wouldn't recommend her Central Asian Studies class, the first problem is the subject is so broad so this anthro class turns into a History course which isn't the same thing.  But if you like history with little tidbits about how people make tents out of yak hair, then by all means.  Also, I love reading and I always do it for my classes, as I did for her course and this is the first course ever where I think the amount of reading she gives is absurd.  And I love reading, I'm not lazy but the amount she gives is insane and she doesn't really tell you which topics to focus while you're reading so you're literally reading hundreds and hundreds of pages THE WHOLE 800 page text book, and you have no idea what you're supposed to be taking note of PLUS  A NOVEL, and the questions she ends up asking are ridiculous because they don't check if you did the reading or not, they check if you can chronologically summarize the reading in the way she asks you too, which isn't very fair when you have to read an entire text book and novel.  And I don't think she shows near enough films for an ethnographic class."
Nancy E Levine,NA,Societies of Central Asia,ANTHRO 163Q,N/A,"Professor Levine is very concerned with student learning and certainly goes out of her way to make sure every bit of information regarding the course is readily available. She even created a review sheet with summaries of all the readings for the midterm and final. She's very passionate about her fieldwork in Tibet and it shows in her lectures - much of the class was focused on the history and current circumstances in Tibet. I found her to be friendly, approachable, and a great professor over all. I would definitely recommend taking a class with her!"
Nancy E Levine,NA,Societies of Central Asia,ANTHRO 163Q,N/A,"Her tests are pretty difficult but she curves them very leniently. She requires a lot of reading and I am guilty of reading hardly any after the midterm. I still got an A. You probably should do the reading, since there is no guarantee the other students won't."
Nancy E Levine,NA,Societies of Central Asia,ANTHRO 163Q,N/A,"This is my first Anthropology class in my life and it's also an upper division class related to my major. I was so afraid that I might not do well as I heard from many students's complaints about Anthropology classes.  However, Prof. Levine is a nice professor and a fair grader.  There's a midterm and a final.  Nothing's  tricky. The materials are drawn from lectures and reading (although there're quite a lot to read for each lecture).   She's patient too -  repeats materials covered in the previous lectures and makes sure that we understand them. There's no way of not getting what she has said unless students can't be bothered to show up in class.  I recommend Prof. Levine as an anthropology teacher."
Orna Johnson,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"What can I say about Professor Johnson...Well, let me put it this way, if I had to choose between her and a pile of rocks to do my taxes, I'd choose the rocks. Ineptitude is far worse than merely being inanimate. She seems to believe that ""revenge"" can be used as a verb (it can't, that would be ""avenge"") and that the past tense of ""drown"" is ""drownded"". She also pretty much completely discounted the Spanish influence on the downfall of the Aztecs and Inca and rather blamed it on their own poor infrastructure and governance (WOW). Students beware: lectures can get infuriating."
Orna Johnson,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,this prof is insane when it comes to assigning work.  i took this class in the summer and altogether we wrote 8 essays.  the readings were too much and it was essays after essays.  she expects so much.  i would not recommend johnson.  her tests were tricky also.
Orna Johnson,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"this class was one of the easiest classes ever. I know that now that I'm taking other GEs. Professor Johnson is okay...her lectures were like the material in the book, which i thought was the best required text i had to read. TA laurie was fantastic! I got an A+ but I also read all the reading and went to almost all the lectures. If anthropology interests you, this class will be an easy A. The work was sometimes a pain but in the end I could definitely say it was fair and easy enough."
Orna Johnson,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A," I highly recommend this professor because she is concerned about student learning.  Her availabilty outside the class is great she was always present at her office hours.  All her lectures were posted online, the text was fairly straight forward, the videos were interesting and relevant to life today, the life history paper was also a fun assignment because you get to get acquainted with people of different backgrounds, and she was really nice when I had trouble doing the research proposal.  I truly enjoyed this class and I would most likely take another course with her.AWESOME PROFESSOR!! The TA's were aslo very helpful and were clearly familiar with all the concepts presented during class and discussion.  I received great help from Laurie and Pamela....they were both great!!!"
Orna Johnson,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A," Prof. Johnson gives a lot of work, I mean A LOT.  Sure, it's easy work but time consuming, especially when you have other, more important courses to look after. TAs such as Laurie and Sasha are awesome and will help you understand the fairly easy concepts. I'd take this course again!"
Orna Johnson,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"dude, i personally messed up because it was my first quarter at ucla, but she is very easy, understanding, lectures are not boring, easy A, interesting and helpful TAs, and not hard midterms/finals.. i should have read more, but i didnt... and i regret that, the reading isnt much.. although u do get  a lot of outside the text book reading posted online, but notes are posted online as well, and she is available outside the classroom and she is very helpful.. highly recommend it.. its not one of those easy A so take it, its a great class too"
Orna Johnson,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"Basically, one of the easiest GE classes at UCLA. All of her slides from lecture are posted online. The reading material is very straightforward, although there was a lot of reading at times. Exams were multiple choice with 2 short essays and I mean short. 4 or 5 lines and she told you the topic they would be on. 1 paper 8-10 pages and 5 video reviews (I'd say every other class was a video in lecture). Not much work required. Definitely take this class with Professor Johnson. Plus, she's a really nice lady who gives students extra credit for going to her office hours. She really likes to interact with the students and she is not intimidating at all. A very nice professor!"
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,"the midterm and final were both ridiculous. you had to read every word of the 400 page textbook to have a chance at getting a B. a very good professor, but her tests are extremely difficult. DONT TAKE IT"
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,"Kennedy knows what she is talking about. She is one of those professors at UCLA where in addition to lecturing a bunch of unappreciative, GE-taking, undergrad non-majors (such as myself), she is also one of the nation's leading academics in the field. That said, her lectures are not always exactly stimulating, but if you stay with it, it's not hard to understand the concepts of the material and then the classes will become much more enjoyable. Exams are tricky with a lot of confusing multiple choice questions on vocabulary. This is why you should take the option to write the paper instead of taking the midterm. You can write it on whatever you want basically, so take advantage. The textbook is unnecessary, but lectures are not. If you get a chance to talk with Kennedy in person, she is a bit standoffish at first, but she really loves this topic so she seems to have a strong desire to be helpful to her students."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,"This was a manageable class.  The grading is a little weird but if you don't do so well on the midterm, writing the paper can definately save you.  Initially the lectures are boring but once you get past pre-evolutionary thinkers the class gets a little more interesting. The tests are entirely based on lecture so I wouldn't suggest buying the book because you won't need it.  As long as you memorize those lecture slides and with a little luck you can do fine on the test.  They were pretty tricky and some of the questions asked about topics which she didn't cover. Definately do the extra credit. And you have to go to lecture.....    "
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,"I'm a third-year and I just took this class as a GE. I generally get good marks -- about a 3.4 overall and an upward trend my last two years. I haven't received a C since winter quarter of my first year and well, I just received another one after completing A12 this past fall with Kennedy. . . so my trend gets broken. Her lectures are pretty clear. I would ignore the textbook altogether and just memorize the slides and whatever she posts. I absolutely hate rote memorization - I'm an English major. So this was a total nightmare for me. The material is easy to follow - it's just the evolutionary biology stuff you've had to learn since 8th grade . .. just here it's a lot of memorization. I'm really upset since I got great marks in all of my other classes. Huge regret. She's a nice professor - exams are very tricky (multiple-choice). Class is curved. 88% was the highest score on the midterm. Go figure. "
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,"Kennedy is by far my favorite professor at UCLA so far.  Her lectures are fascinating, but you do need to attend them all to do well in her class.  But seriously, I took 12 with her last year and sought her out again this year for my 120 requirement because I learned so much in Anthro 12.  The material is hard, but the tests are focused completely on lecture, so if you can't get to all of the reading it's generally okay.  I always ask her questions after class and she is really patient and eager to hear my feedback.  She is so knowledgeable about everything she teaches so if you are interested in the subject of her class, I guarantee you will like her and all the studying will be worth it.  Her tests are really hard, so just be prepared for that and study your notes and the slides.  Any word she writes on the board will probably be on the test.  If you are an anthro major though, you should definitely take her at some point before you graduate."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,"I don't recommend Kennedy.  Her lectures were unclear, and the TA's had no idea what was going on, so the only way to study for tests was to read the book and go through all of her lecture slides.  This class was HARD.  I got a good grade after I pulled 2 all-nighters before the final.  Not enjoyable or recommendable."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,"Kennedy is an awesome professor. The class is very easy if you do it right. The same goes for practically all classes. Her lecturers are extremely interesting, and she is a very nice lady, who is always open to explain things better if you need her to. You need to go to every lecture, and take notes. Tests come from lecture notes and section. There really is only a couple of concepts every lecture that she goes over in detail. The information is not bad at all. The reading for section is very minimal, and the class overall is very laidback -- as long as you go to lecture and take notes. There is an option to take the midterm or the paper or a mixture of both. Do the paper -- you'll get a better grade. For the final, spend a full day making flash cards, and spend two studying them. Your set for the final. The TAs for the class know everything, use them!!!"
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,"Kennedy's really hard, but she's a great teacher. Her lectures are interesting and the material isn't bad. I am an anthro major, though. I wouldn't reccommend taking this class for a GE, but through the majority of the quarter it's pretty chill. It's just during finals that it gets really hard. She has an option of either writing a 10 page research paper due at the end of the quarter or taking the midterm, which is kinda nice."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,"This is a class on the principles of human evolution so I was appalled when I heard the professor giving incorrect information on what evolution and natural selection are in lecture. These are the basis of the class! I would have hoped the professor would get these correct. As an evolutionary biology major I approached her about this and she told me that the correct definitions were just other biologists ""takes"" on evolution and that her way was more concise, but the same thing-- despite that they were completely different. She is a very dry and dull lecturer, but regardless of teaching style I cannot recommend any class in which the professor is teaching incorrect information. I am very disappointed as human evolution is a very fascinating subject. I hope that the students that have taken and will have to take this class with Dr. Kennedy get the chance to learn correct information at some point in their academic careers."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,"I'm an Anthro B.S. major so that's probably why I really enjoyed the class (even though I got a B+). No matter how simple the material is, you have to get an A on the midterm (35%) and the final (65%) to get an A in the class. I got a A on my midterm, but B+ on my final, hence the class grade. The final ques are VERY specific,but ""fair."" Test material is off her lectures, so the book was a waste of money; discussions are useless unless your TA actually knows what she's talking about (e.g. doesn't say ""I will ask the professor everytime u ask her a ques"") and attendance is not part of your grade. Kennedy is extremely approacheable and really wants you to understand the material. In summary, great teacher, great material learned; not so great of a TA, terrible grading policy."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,"I did not like this class... maybe it's because I am an Anthro major interested in archaeology. I know that sounds weird, but I also got the feeling she DOES hate archaeologists. Wonder why? This class made me want to RUN away from evolutional theory screaming! Her lectures are boring, the readings are worse, and I was not inspired to do ANYTHING for the class but try to get out of it as quickly as possible. The tests are ALL multiple choice, which simply means, read, study and regurgitate. That's not why I am at UCLA, I did enough of that in high school. I got an A without even trying, or going to section. So if you want Anthro done easy, this class is for you."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,"Kennedy is horrible.  Her lectures are so pointless, you have no ideas what is her points, and what will she test you on."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,"Don't bother buying the book. I made the mistake of buying the book and (i kid you not) did NOT open it ONCE throughout the whole quarter. This one of those classes where you just MUST go to lecture and take down the notes. Classes like these are pretty easy because all that you are tested on is the information covered in class, meaning, your own notes. she doesn't talk too fast so it's easy to take everything down. study your notes thoroughly a couple days before the midterm and final and you'll get an A in the course."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,"Professor Kennedy was dinitely very knowledgeable about the material.  However, she is unbelievably boring.  The subject material is fascinating but Professor Kennedy can put you to sleep faster than any professor can.  I literally had to drink coffee and eat candy before lecture. She is a very fair grader and does her best to help students get the best grade possible.  Overall it was an okay class, I got an A+.  I'd take it again."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,"Professor Kennedy's class was one of the most informative classes I have ever taken.  The option to write the paper and drop a midterm also takes some pressure off of the class, and she is very generous with her curve as compared with other professors.  The class was incredibly interesting and I learned so much from this class.  You definitely have to study for the midterms and final, but as long as you attend lecture and section you will do fine.  Highly recommended to any students who actually go to classes that they sign up for."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,DO not take this class. If i could go back I would not take it. Don't do it.
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A," The previous students wrote things that weren't true. 1st, on a curve there is NO WAY you can get a natural A, B, C, etc. and be MARKED DOWN.  PERIOD.  The curve only raises your grade--never lowers it.  We start out breaking down the grades into the natural curve--90%+ is an A, 80%+ is a B.  Then from there we curve UP. If this student indeed got a 90% overall class grade they would have received an A.  I invite this student to contact their T.A. for an explanation of how things work in gradingland. 2nd, the textbook was NOT outdated.  It is the latest edition and less than 2 years old.  However, as Anthropology is a constantly changing science, and many new findings have cropped up, the text needed to be qualified several times during lecture snd section--and then, it was only the chapters pertaining to fossils.  If you want to take a class that never changes, stick with History! Finally, the average on the final was a 68/100, not a 59/100.  A 69 on the final would not have given this student an A unless he/she did extremely well on the rest of the class materials.  Once again, the curve would RAISE, not lower a grade, but no way a 69 (a natural D) would get marked up to an A. I am always astounded at how students feel they can come in here and print blatant mistruths.  As a T.A. I wanted to set the record straight."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,"Dr. Kennedy definately knows what she's talking about. I found this class to be very interesting as it is about human evolution. Lectures are really boring though...and the book didn't help at all because it was outdated. Her midterms, and finals are straight from her lectures. If you memorize them, I promise you'll do well. Beware of her exams though, as her format is A, B, both A and B, B only, none of the above. This can really throw you off. Memorize the charts that she puts on the web because several questions on the exams are relating to them. And if you want to do well in this class, WRITE THE OPTIONAL PAPER!"
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,"I found Kennedy to be monotone and dead. I went into the class incredibly interested in human evolution but was sorely disappointed when I found myself falling asleep in lecture or attempting to navigate through her convoluted lecture structure. She is incredibly ambiguous and contradicts herself multiple times each lecture. Finals and midterms are heinous and she grades on a bell curve which means you can get a 90% or better and end up with a B. This class is terrible, so cross your fingers for good lecture notes and a TA with a sense of humor."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,"definitely a VERY intelligent lady.  she made me feel like an idiot when i went to her office for a little bit of input/guidance on my paper about theories of origin of modern man, but the feedback she gave and her recommendations for researching other sources were extremely helpful.  most people slept through lecture.  or so i heard.  i never really went after the first midterm, which i got a C- on ... B or B- with the curve.  The average on our final was 59/100, so with a 69, I earned an A.  The paper wasn't that bad.  I was in the honors discussion, and went about half the time, did the reading about 1/4 the time ... but I ended up with a magic A at the end of the quarter.  I did work my ass off for the paper though, and wrote a damn good one: like, I turned it in and thought ""wow, did I really write that?  I rock!""  And I studied like mad the entire late afternoon-night-morning before the final exam.  But I learned some pretty interesting stuff.  If I wanted to be an anthro major, I would have been more into it, but I took the class as a GE.  Even though I half-assed it for the majority of the quarter, when I did put in the effort, I found it to be worthwhile, and a lot of the course material is actually pretty cool to think about."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,"Dr. Kennedy is an amazing professor--if you are truly interested, read her curriculum vitae.  She has such an understanding about the material that she is presenting, and although her lectures are a trifle slow, they are enjoyable and well worth it.  Her tests are very fair, and she presents the material in a methodical, easy to commprehend format that is very professional and informative.  She has great presence in the lecture hall--you can learn a lot from her!!"
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,"Thank goodness this class is OVER!  Professor Kennedy really made this class dense and boring.  First of all, because I sought her outside of class, I understand that she is intelligent and a kind, interested person.  But her lectures are the worst.  They're very unstructured... she puts up a few overheads on the web but that's about it.  Be prepared to take some hard-core notes in this class.  But even that's difficult because your mind is going to wander SOOO much ... I seriously wrote my name 1000 times in my notes just because I was that bored.  Her voice is really soft and shaky, she is very awkward, and she just didn't capture my interest at all in class.  I also was in her Honors discussion section... which was even more unstructured... no specific questions asked... just general ones that didn't seem to have any answers.  When I was studying for the exams (more the 2nd midterm and final... the first one was easy) I didn't even know where to begin studying.  The book is useless because it's outdated so it's all based on lectures which I've already said are quite painful.  As for the exams... they're CRAZY!  It's like A., B., C., A&C, B&C, none of the above, all of the above..... and the answer is just B...... it's very tricky and it makes you doubt yourself a LOT.  I did the paper... what a waste of an entire weekend.  But I think it's really important that you do her grading option number three which is to take all the exams and do the paper.  She'll drop your lowest score (trust me... you'll have one) and give you 10 extra points which will prove to be very VALUABLE!!!!  I just did not enjoy this class at all... it wasn't organized the way I would've liked it to be and we didn't really go in depth on a lot of the things she brought up.  I got an A in the course because I worked hard and I refused to do poorly just because she was so dull... but if you lack this motivation, and the hominid FEMUR doesn't excite you, do yourself a favor and take a different course."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,"Not the most animated professor .. actually a bit boring. But if you are interested in anthropology at all then this is an excellent course to take. I learned an amazing amount about evolution. As for difficulty? I could see it being very tough to get an A in this class. I took it P/NP, but that still wasn't a walk in the park."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,"I really enjoyed Dr. Kennedy's class; I found her lectures to always be quite interesting.  Her tests are indeed challening, but lecture notes are available to help you prepare.  Dr. Kennnedy gives you options of how to earn your grade which include writing a paper and having your lowest score dropped.  In my personal experience with her, I found her to be available and always willing to help out...like others have said she seems intimidating at first, probably due to the fact that she is a highly noted expert in her field (I hear she's the foremost authority on the femur), but when she is a very nice person to speak with.My advice is to not miss discussion; she tests you on material you learn in there and it is very helpful.  Do not put off studying until the night before...you have to know the material well.  Overall, I would recommend Kennedy highly if you want an intersting class which you will get something out of.  NOT FOR THE SLACKER; grades are NOT handed out on silver platters."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Principles of Human Evolution: Comparative Analysis,ANTHRO 12,N/A,"I really enjoyed this class, but beware it is time consuming.  Dr. Kennedy presents so much detail in her lectures that it's sometimes hard to keep up with her.  This is an active note taking class, sometimes during my notetaking I would forget when was the last time I looked up. If you want an A, you're going to have to really put in the time and effort.  Out of conceptual physics and stats, anthro 12 took up the majority of my time.  Her tests are often times confusing--she definitely uses options D and E to their full potential, so you have to really know your stuff.  After it is all said and done, I really feel like I have learned something significant and valuable.  It is easy to get intimidated by Dr. Kennedy because she is practically a walking encyclopedia, but this is what UCLA is all about, being taught by the best."

Gail E Kennedy,NA,Paleopathology,ANTHRO 126P,N/A," I took her for 129Q and was freaked out over the reviews here. 2.07 for being hard? She is by far easier than that. Her tests require you to study, but she's VERY straight forward. You have to work for it, but DO NOT PSYCH YOURSELF OUT. As mentioned before always make note of what is in yellow in the slide.  She knows so much in her field and is actually a bit of a revolutionary she's worth to take and learn from. She is so well established in her field. you can find docs with her in it! As a disabled student with OSD, she didn't treatment me any differently. She expected a lot, but when OSD failed me she was willing to help me far beyond a professor is normally willing to do. Meaning, she was willing to provide herself as a proctor my exam last minute. Don't expect this of her, but I was so honored she didn't hesitate to help when OSD failed me. VERY personable. Don't hesitate to ask her anything in class and in office hours, just be prepared she is very knowledgable and can give you a very detailed answer. Very concise. You WILL be in awe of her. Even though she was a little work (read 1/3 of the reading book, and went to every lecture and got an A-) I am taking her again for Anthro 121C. She's amazing, very knowledgable, and you'd want more."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Paleopathology,ANTHRO 126P,N/A," I liked Kennedy in general. Her lectures were interesting. I did not like that grade is weighed only on a mid-term and a final. I attended every lecture and studied hard.  Come test time, I thought I did well but ended up failing her class. I was (and still am) in complete shock.  I can't even re-take her class to improve my GPA because she decided not to offer it again. Also, I knew a couple of students with disabilities in her class. They told me that Kennedy greatly disliked cooperating with them.  I liked the material, but be cautious. "
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Paleopathology,ANTHRO 126P,N/A," Phenomenal Professor & an extremely fascinating, relevant, and up to date class. If you're looking for that easy A, its not for you. You HAVE to work. You have to go to lecture, as well as do some of the more important readings, and memorize a shit load of stuff. The material is more complex than usual, but it is extremely interesting and Professor Kennedy is a boss when it comes to this stuff. If you actually care about learning something of substance and not being a lazy shit, take this class and you'll leave knowing a whole lot more about human beings and how we live/have lived.  Also, the TA Brittany was great and really knew her stuff. She went out of her way to help students with whatever they needed and whenever the Professor was struggling to explain something or answer a student's question, Brittany would come in and have an answer for you that made sense and didn't make you feel stupid for asking. Tips:Everything in yellow on the powerpoint slides is fair game for a test questionBone anatomy & contagious diseases are the most important topics of all Test format:Usually a combination of definitions, pathology identification, compare/contrast, essay (both long & short) Class format:1 Midterm - 25%1 5/6 page Paper - 25%1 Final - 50%"
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Paleopathology,ANTHRO 126P,N/A," Professor Kennedy is excellent. Her classes are challenging, but there are some steps you can take to get an A. I have taken paleopathology, osteology, and evolution of genus homo with her. A lot of her students in paleo seem concerned about the exams, so here are some tips. Make flash cards for everything in yellow in her slideshows. Know synonyms for all terminology in yellow. KNOW THEM VERY WELL. Kennedy loves trick questions. Ask a TA about which readings you will need to know. I would not advise trying to memorize all of them. Instead, make a list of specific articles you have been told by the TA or Kennedy you will need to know, and make an outline of the major points for each. When I took paleo with her, most of the questions on the exams were short answer, so be smart about what you study and know what you choose to study well.  Overall, while her classes are challenging, they are doable, and definitely worth taking.  "

Gail E Kennedy,NA,Paleopathology,ANTHRO 126P,N/A,"Professor Kennedy is the best professor I have had at UCLA. She is one of the only professors in the Anthropology department who is considered an expert in her field and it definitely shows in her lectures! Everything she says is fascinating, I go to class and I am regularly stunned by what she teaches and the way she is able to explain things in depth with amazing pictures to go along with her lectures. This is one of the only classes I have ever taken that I was genuinely excited to go to class; I was actually sad when she cancelled class randomly one day. If you're interested in being taught by a wonderful professor who is overflowing with knowledge in the field, take a class with Kennedy. She really cares about her students and has a huge wealth of knowledge to offer. 129Q especially-cannibalism, foot binding, amputations, trepanations...seriously interesting stuff! "
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Paleopathology,ANTHRO 126P,N/A,"This is just a fascinating class. A lot of times I have a really hard time focussing but I notice I never drift off or end up on Facebook in class. Professor Kennedy just has a way of being surprisingly engaging despite the slightly dull voice. And you can tell she knows her stuff. The readings are pretty cool. Only critiques however: the slides are all pictures with basically no reference to what they mean, the pictures are cool but it doesn't really help you study. Also tests are SUPER hit or miss. They're specific so you know it or you don't. And theres going to be stuff you don't know no matter how hard you study, its easy to miss a specific word thats only been mentioned once or twice."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Paleopathology,ANTHRO 126P,N/A,"One of the BEST classes in the whole anthro department. There was a lot to memorize, but it was all very interesting. She was very informative and funny, and you have to go to all of the lectures. There were a lot of readings, but most of it got right to the point, and were much easier to get a hang of after hearing explain the basis in the lectures. Tests were hard, remember to look over her powerpoints. Not an easy A but definitely worth taking."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Paleopathology,ANTHRO 126P,N/A," this was my favorite class this quarter. She is one of the only ""certified anthropology experts"" at our school. She had a dry sense of humor, and was clearly very knowledgeable of this subject. the only thing I would complain about is that she assigns a lot of readings. She narrows them down for the midterm, so I would suggest reading everything, but dont bother memorizing things until she mentions which readings will be on the test. One other thing was that the person that grades her tests was very picky. All her tests are defs/short answers/ essay format. And if one or two words are missing that she wanted, you get docked points. Last complaint, her final was 65% of your grade, which was very stressful, however i found the final easier then the midterm... KNOW all the bone biology definitions and things that she highlights or underlines in yellow. She includes a lot of extra information in lecture to add to her point (and its always relly interseting)  and its somewhat difficult to know whats important. But just know vocab and things in yellow. You definitely have to come to lecture, or buy lecture notes. Reviewing the slides online will not be enough. I found making notecards a really good study method. Overall, i loved her and this class, and would recommend it to anyone"
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Paleopathology,ANTHRO 126P,N/A,"I love Kennedy's classes! Her lectures are very very interesting and she knows so much about the topics. However it is lots of information to remember but she at leasts posts her lectures online. But I would recommend still coming to lecture because she explains a lot of pictures of bones diseases and ect.You will learn so much in this course, or any other course you would take with her, but be prepared to study well for the exams. She can be tricky. There are no multiple choice questions, just short answers, definitions, compare and contrast, and a long essay or two. I have her final on friday, But I did fairly well on the midterm."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Paleopathology,ANTHRO 126P,N/A,"PLEASE READ if you are the TA that posted earlier. What he/she said about Kennedy was not true, and the student was right. I am taking Paleopathology, and although I enjoy the class very much and I think Kennedy is a great professor, I was very disappointed with the grades. I got an 83%, but she CURVED AGAINST us because we have a bunch of freakish overachieving anthro majors in the class...so I got a C!!! I'm hoping my final grade is nothing like this, but I have gotten only A's and B's since I started taking upper div, and I'm considering taking this class P/NP because of this. Lastly, I want to take a class with her next quarter but this is deterring me. ONLY take a class with her if you are willing to lower your GPA."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Evolution of Genus Homo,ANTHRO 126Q,A,"121C is an amazing class for Anthro majors or anyone interested in Evolution. Professor Kennedy is amazingly kind in office hours and willing to help everyone grasp concepts. She held two study sessions, one for the midterm and one for the final. I recommend that when taking this class you create a schedule of when to tackle the readings (there are a lot) and keep up with it on your own. Professor Kennedy goes through the slides during class, but she doesn't give deadlines or a timeline for when to get readings done, so that will have to be managed on your own. Otherwise, a really great class with engaging material!"
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Evolution of Genus Homo,ANTHRO 126Q,N/A,"I thought Professor Kennedy was amazing! She's so interesting; I was hooked onto every one of her lectures.  Granted, if you're not a huge fan of the history of humans or primate behavior, etc., you probably won't find her class that interesting. But for those who do - she is definitely the woman to learn it from.  Her tests were very fair - difficult only in the fact that she expects you to know what's she's discussed in lecture.  But she tells you which of the articles she assigns to concentrate on, so there is definitely nothing to complain about for the readings.  She also posts the lecture slides, so for those who prefer slides to writing, that was available.  We had a weekly one page essay for our reflections to a question she would ask, and we had one midterm and one final.  I didn't do very well on the midterm, but studied harder for the final and ended up with an A in the class. Overall, I would definitely recommend Kennedy for she's one of the most interesting professors I've had the pleasure to have at this school."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Evolution of Genus Homo,ANTHRO 126Q,N/A,"Kennedy is a great professor.  You will learn a crazy amount from her, but you will have to do the work.  You must attend every discussion section.  You will have to do a weekly homework assignment (about 1 page response to a question she assigns in class).  For the homework responses and the tests you will definitely benefit from doing the readings, definitely skim at the very least.  She posts the lecture notes online but a lot of them make absolutely no sense unless you were in class to hear what they refer to.  The midterm and final are short answer and essay questions that call on a lot of specific detail.  She explains everything really well and definitely gives you the resources to do well in her class.  I learned a lot from Kennedy and ended up with a B in the class.  If I had been willing to put in a little more work, I definitely could have received an A.  This class is doable and enjoyable, but be willing to work for your grade. "
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Evolution of Genus Homo,ANTHRO 126Q,N/A,"Prof. Kennedy is great. Her lectures are engaging and she is very knowledgeable about the material. She assigns a decent amount of reading and one very straightforward homework question per week. Her exams are pretty difficult in terms of the amount of details that you need to know, so make sure you go to class because those detailed questions often come from lectures. I went to every lecture and section, did all the homework, and consistently scored A- on the midterm and final, and I ended up with an A+"
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Evolution of Genus Homo,ANTHRO 126Q,N/A,"This class, evolution of the genus homo, should be taken with a grain of salt.  Professor Kennedy often makes quite bold claims and has little to back them up.  If anyone speaks up about them, she gets defensive and quickly moves on.  I started the class thinking she was brilliant and left it thinking she was just egotistical.  I think she is the foremost expert in some aspects of anthropology and knows very little about others.  She also seems to detest archaeology for some reason, which is strange because everything she studies started with an archaeologist."
Gail E Kennedy,NA,Evolution of Genus Homo,ANTHRO 126Q,N/A,"A great class to take for learning about human evolution. She is a first rate professor and even if you do write a lot of notes in class, thats what you expect, better than some classes where all you do is stare at the wall and wait for it to end. The paper assignment though is very tough. I took it for CR/NCR just so I could enjoy the class and not be stressed out."
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,F," Dropped this class two weeks in because the professor treated us like middle schoolers. First of all, she started her first lecture by telling us we were not allowed to use laptops, and if we had to use it, we had to sit at the back of the class and she would get TAs to monitor us. She probably forgot about it because no one really cared the next lecture.  Secondly, her lectures are incredibly dull and she goes off tangents. She spent 35 minutes one lecture for us to finish an activity that would not be graded at all, and most people started to get bored 10 minutes in. She also went off tangent talking about topics that did not contribute to the class whatsoever for another 10 minutes. Most people in class and my discussion were complaining about her lectures because they were incredibly unorganized and did not have any coherency.  Thirdly, I can't emphasize how much this lecturer treated us like middle schoolers, which was incredibly frustrating. I missed the end of a lecture due to a conflicting lecture and I absentmindedly rushed off without collecting my assignment. I emailed the professor because the assignment was 10% and she did not care to upload a 10% assignment online. I was rejected and she told me that it was my fault (which is), and she would not send me a copy of the 10% graded assignment. Seriously? I would have understood if the assignment was 1% of my grade, but turning down a 10% assignment was really unfair because I made a simple mistake and I apologized for it. Having a 10% take home assignment that she stubbornly refuses to upload online was pretty unfair because people might have emergencies that cause them to miss their lecture. Her inflexibility led me to believe that this class is simply not worth it at all. Fourth, she took 15 minutes to go through the IPA chart, contributing to much confusion in class. She then proceeded to throw us her webpage and kept advertising how good it was and how we should do all our learning on her webpage. I would have understood if this was some readings to supplement our knowledge of the subject, but the fact is that she barely even touched upon the subject (what is this class about, anyway?) and made us learn what was essential for the class by ourselves. She then proceeded to ask us for tips on learning it when it was her responsibility to teach us this. Lastly, she made us take CITI training courses that are a complete waste of time because we would never need it at all, she even stated that. I've asked someone else who took this course under another professor - he never had to take it at all. Basically she wasted an entire week of lecture on a useless online training course that would not have helped us at all without understanding of this course and was incredibly dry and boring."
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"I'm in this class rn and imma be honest idk wtf is going on, she has no idea what she's teaching and the other day we literally went over the skskksks and an i oop- meme for god knows what reason, I wish I would have switched out of this class when I had the chance. She's expecting us to turn in a 40-60 page paper on top of our other classes."
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A," This class was truly a mess from start to finish. I thought about dropping like many of the other students did but I decided to stick with it. The material itself is not difficult. The homework assignments and take home tests were straight forward and graded easily. However the group project was a nightmare.  The project originally required each person in a group to write ten pages about a two minute section from an interview conducted by the group. The TAs actually got together and begged the professor to lower the word count because it was so outrageous. The final project guidelines changed up until week 9. On top of this, we were expected to do a heavy amount of reading which barely contributed to the actual work so no one bothered. The project ended up being graded easily but the easy grade was not worth the disorganization and the stress caused by the professor. The TA’s are the only redeemable part of the course. From what I’ve heard they’re all amazing and I can vouch that my own (Yanina) was crucial in finishing this course. Overall, I wouldn’t take it again."
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,Very unorganized class.. nice person but no one knows wtf is happening in this class. Like every lecture you attend will just further confuse you.. Its week 9 and everyone still doesn't know what this class even is
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"The most important thing to know about this class is that you can never show up without water because THIS CLASS IS DRY. By far the most boring class I've ever attended in all my years. One of those classes where they treat everyday phenomena like revolutionary breakthroughs because they write their observations on paper and give it a name. But it was an easy A where you could stop attending lectures after Week 2 and never (and I do mean never) have to do the readings because they don't test you on the material. You are basically a pawn in this professor's research. When she isn't giving boring lectures she's just telling you how to conduct you ""research""."
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"I am currently taking this class, and i have to say that this is absolutely one of the WORST classes I have taken here at UCLA, and I have taken econ 11 with professor Zame. The only interesting thing about this class is the IPA, but that's about all you will actually learn thanks to the TA's, especially Sasha--a Queen!This professor lacks organization completely, this class has no structure whatsoever and she seems to have no idea how to lecture. This class is a mediocre disgrace to anthropology and it lacks any real tangibility. You don't learn a damn thing other than the fact that some professors still collect homework during lecture for 20 minutes.The group project is horrible, she didn't even have the guidelines up until week 5 and she wants to talk about ""we have no midterm or final"" OF COURSE WE DONT, AND WE SHOULDN'T. WE HAVE 5 WEEKS TO DO A WHOLE RESEARCH PROJECT (INTERVIEWS, PROPOSALS, 30 PAGE PAPER) ON TOP OF ALL OF OUR OTHER CLASSES THAT ALSO REQUIRE PAPERS, EXAMS, AND FINALS.Don't take this class AT ALL.  I honestly don't even know how the department let this be a class, and i still don't even know what i'm suppose to get out of this class.Goodluck Charlie"
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"Although I came out of this class with a good grade, it was so boring. No even half the class would show up to lectures and the lectures were unstructured and confusing. The workload is easy but the content is lagging. Only take this class if you are desperate."
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"The class concept is really interesting, but I'm not sure how much I actually learned. Some of the readings were really eye-opening and engaging, but others were super boring... fortunately you can get away with not really reading them. I had an amazing teaching assistant (Hannah Carlan)--highly would recommend because she clarified everything and summarized it well, although I've heard all of the TA's are great. Professor Mendoza-Denton was an alright lecturer, but lecture isn't super necessary, especially if you have a great TA."
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"This class is centered around the final group project. This project is basically collecting data for the LA Speaks Project. Do not expect to delve deep into Anthropology in this course. Instead, expect to complete a lot of research where its significance is not necessarily explained. Additionally, it is not always clear what is expected of you or when it is due (as many of the due dates were changed frequently). Overall, this course was an easy A and is manageable. However, expect to have to Uber to different parts of LA several times to complete research and to be a bit on edge as due dates and specific assignments weren't always clear."
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"The main focus that the professor kept emphasizing was the final project which was due at the end of the quarter. It was a group project up to 5 people in a group, each contributing at least 2,000 words to the project. Lectures were packed in the beginning weeks, but eventually I remember one time I counted only 15 students in the room maybe around week 7 or 8. I liked this class mainly because of my TA and the people I met in which it was easy to talk and relate our feelings on how the class was unorganized and being confused during lectures. In the beginning of the quarter, they said we would discuss the readings during discussions so I bought the required texts, but we never did discuss them.. I could have saved the money if I knew that ://  I think I missed a couple of discussion sections, but still got an A+. This class is manageable if you're able to find people to interview asap and are willing to meet up with your groupmates a couple of times in the city you choose. Good luck if you need to take this class :)"
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"I would not recommend anyone to take this class. This is a relatively easy GE because you literally don´t have to go to any of the lectures because they are not useful at all. The professor often doesn´t use slides and is not organized at all, we spend one whole lecture just discussing the word ""like"" , and no one had any idea what was going on or what the lecture or final project would be about until the third week of classes. For the final project you have to get together with a group of 4/5 people from your discussion and interview people on the streets which is very boring and a pain in the ass project which is not useful or interesting at all. She wanted us to study the accent of the people who live in Los Angeles and for the final paper each PERSON from the group needed to contribute 2 000 WORDS to the same paper analysing a 2min piece of your interview. It is very anoying paper to write and you don´t learn anything doing it, at some point you just make things up to reach the word count. If you like to write and don´t mind group projects you can take this class cause it´s an easy A if you deliver all the work, but I feel like you could spend your time doing something more useful."
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A,"This reviews are so dramatic—this class was an actual cake walk, and the fact that she's ""a bad lecturer"" doesn't matter because you don't have to go to class. She streamed classes on zoom as well, and the one quiz we had was graded for completion and was just used for attendance—but she let us make it up if we missed it! AND She told us what day it was going to be on—so if you missed it that's completely your fault. You will be lost about what to do for our big final project if you skip all your TA sessions—so that's literally the bare minimum you should do. This class was great, would 100% take again."
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,Easy A but not the most engaging class or professor. Some in class quizzes used only for attendance : the grade won't matter. No real need to do the reading. Grade is mostly based on a final group project that's kind of tedious but fairly graded.
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"I believe that my class with Professor Mendoza-Denton was a special exception, as our focus was doing her research. It was defintely more work than I expected, but only towards the end of the course. In the beginning of the course, there was basically no work. I probably should've dropped it when I discovered how much work there would be later, but I stuck with it. She occasionally took attendance in class by having us write on a piece of paper or something like that, but I seriously doubt that it effected my grade, or if she even looked at it again. The lectures are super all over the place, but that in itself was kind of interesting. I almost never took notes. We had 3 homeworks, 2 of which were later absorbed by our final project. I often got really stressed out about this class, as she originally wanted us to do more work for our projects than we ended up doing. The amount of work we had to do for her research/our projects was lowered nearly every time we had lecture, thanks to the TAs. I did not like that we had to travel to another neighborhood in LA for one homework, as it took up a lot of time and was expensive to do so, and some members of the group would have to travel to interview people. The final project was a lot of work, even with it being shortened by the TAs, so my group met nearly twice a week for about 3 weeks. The bulk of the work was monitored by my TA, Hannah, during discussion. She often seemed very annoyed at how much work the professor was trying to give us, and sometimes even with the material that she was teaching. One part of our project was to give a small presentation about our neighborhood and its accent during discussion, which was probably the most stressful and least guided part of the project. I was super concerned when handing in our project, because some of the guidelines were unclear, and it was about 52 pages (this does include all of our previous homeworks and the work was divided into 5). However, they graded it super quickly and gave us an A+, which makes me believe that they didn't end up actually reading our papers, but instead just took our interviews to use in Norma's research. I can't say that I would take this class again, even though my group ended up doing well. It was way too much work for me, especially since I was taking it as a GE, and it kind of scared me off of Anthropology completely. However, I don't think that she would use Anthro 4 to do this same research again, since we provided so much data for her through our projects. She is generally a nice person, but she expected too much from us in this class, and was often unclear/confusing during lecture."
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A,"This class was a disaster from start to finish. As my first class as a transfer to UCLA, I had high expectations. I was quickly met with disappointment in the course and professor. First, I want to make it clear that the professor is a sweet person and this is not a personal criticism. However, there is no reason for her to be a professor. It is so evident that she only cares about her research, and that's why she's here. The lectures are extremely disorganized, even the TA's have no idea what is going on, which even led to some of them arguing with her during lecture about her offering extra credit opportunities to some students but not others. She made it seem like we would need to know IPA, and made us take assessments that didn't end up counting towards our grade. The class consists of one huge group research project, which is such a recipe for disaster. We were supposed to find people in LA to analyze the speech patterns of different neighborhoods, but it was such a high expectation for people to coordinate with each other that a majority of the groups falsified their data to get an A. Overall, the only thing I learned from her class is to check reviews of professors first, if I knew what a disaster it would be I would never have taken it. Also that big group project I mentioned, they didn't grade it!!! They ended up just submitting final grades and not entering in the individual grades. I would not be surprised if she gave people A's to cover up for the fact that the class was a disaster. Also she wanted us to read parts of her own book and review it, which is SUCH a turnoff for me from professors, and it plays into that anthropologist stereotype where all they want to do is brag about their research and have students stroke their ego for them. Overall, if you want an A take the class (I didn't go for four weeks and still got an A.) But if you want stimulating material and a professor who cares about teaching, this class is not for you. What a poor introduction to UCLA."
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+," Take this class if you want an EASY A+ in a GE. Don't take this class if you want to actually learn something. Fall 2019, Professor Mendoza-Denton reorganized the class, so old reviews are not applicable anymore. Basically, this is a linguistic anthropology class now.  The entire quarter, Professor Mendoza-Denton had no idea what was going on in the class. Lectures were unorganized, and there was little to no communication with TA's. My TA, Yanina, was very sweet and helpful, and all the TA's want to help you succeed in the class.  Your grade in the class is based on a few homework assignments and a group project. The group project is pretty time consuming, because you have to do research and actually go out somewhere in Los Angeles and interview two people. So choose your group mates wisely. But, even if you have a bad group, the grading on the project is so lenient that as long as you follow the TA's guidelines and work with them during office hours, you will get an A+ in the class.  I thought what we discussed in class had potential to be really interesting, and the group project seemed fun, but the lack of organization and clarity in the class really destroyed any interest I had in the class."
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"Very good class highly recommend. Make sure you get good group mates that are willing to go out and do the research early because its a lot of work but very doable if you get on it early. My TA was awesome and helpful, use them."
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A,"I never write reviews but I felt the need to tell whoever is reading this now - don't waste your time taking this class. From start to finish, the course was disorganized and useless. The wonderful TA's ended up grading our final projects easily, but the amount of stress this class created for us students was ridiculous. By far the worst class I have taken at UCLA thus far. Take this course with a different professor."
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"This class was super different; I don't think I learned much in this class after week 2. She was super nice and everything but her lectures weren't engaging at all. She encouraged us to do the readings but we were never quizzed on anything so no one ever read. The group project was pretty easy if you just go out and interview someone, but then again I got lucky and was placed into a group with people who actually cared (not many did). Super easy A, it was just really annoying having to come to class when I could've been doing something more worth my time."
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A," Norma is honestly a really interesting person. The fact that she actually went out and embarked on this in-depth field work is quite impressive and gives her a lot of credibility. But oh my gosh is this class boring. Albeit, I'm a STEM person through and through, but STILL.  Towards the end of the quarter, I couldn't even will myself to stay until the end of the lectures. The material covered in lectures, as well as the readings are not relevant AT ALL to the actual work that you need to put into this class. So basically, LISTEN UP EVERYONE WHO ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT GETTING AN EASY A AND NOT LEARNING ANTHROPOLOGY:You don't need to do the readings. You don't need to pay attention to lectures (I just did online shopping--I would still go, in case she does like a random stupid exit slip or whatever). You don't need to worry about whatever phonetics is or how the best way to conduct an interview. All you need to do is put in the work for the final GROUP essay at the end. Select a neighborhood that's close to campus. Take a few pictures and make a few mental observations (about diversity, dialect, and the lot). When assigning tasks in your group, choose to do transcription! That way you don't have to actually interview anyone! You just take like 15 minutes to type the audio recording of the interview (transcription is wayyy easier than Norma will let on in class). Bulk up your portion of the paper with subjective analysis that the TAs can't question. And there you have it! An easy A in a necessary GE! Norma herself is a sweetheart. The class would constantly laugh and smile throughout lectures. Norma has no intention of stressing out her students whatsoever. She kept minimizing workload throughout the quarter and she broke down ""difficult"" concepts from the ""required"" readings in her slides. My TA, Hannah Carlan, was irritable and confused, but easy enough for me to never pay attention and still get an A in the class."
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+," This class was one of my first at UCLA, and I honestly wish it wasn't. Don't let the grade deceive you, this was a mess of a class that ended up being graded easily and I did extra credit for. From the beginning, the professor confessed that our class was a lab rat for her ginormous research project and we would all be doing extensively long group research papers for her. This was, to say the least, very annoying.  The research project's guidelines kept on shifting and changing as the quarter went on. Due to extensive complaints from the class (which was mostly freshmen I think) and the TAs begging the professor, the paper ended up being cut down. We didn't know exactly what we needed to do until week 9. I spent a shit ton of money on Ubers to scout the location I was researching and interviewing people there. However, I didn't have to buy any materials, so I guess it balances out? Attending lecture was a complete waste of time. Professor. MD would go on tangents about her research or absolutely nothing that related to what we were doing. I remember a specific lecture where we talked about ""sksksk"" and ""anna oop"" for an hour... yeah. The professor is not a good lecturer, as she was acting like a lecture hall of 300 people was a graduate class of 20. Luckily, nothing that she said in class was of importance. The TAs were godsends throughout all of this. They understood our struggles and tried to communicate them with the professor as much as possible, at one point they begged her to lower the word count for the group papers. The only gripe I have with them is the homework grading was very inconsistent; one TA would give out extensions and extra credit like nobody's business, while mine stuck strictly to the grading rubric. Felt really unfair when my friends in one TAs section got better grades than me just because their TA was ""more chill."" Overall, this class was definitely a mess and I don't know if it will improve in later quarters. I got a good grade, but take it at your own risk."
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A-,"Norma Mendoza Denton is truly a nice lady and she's very passionate about what she teaches. However, these are by far the most uninteresting, disorganized lectures about absolutely nothing relevant.  I don't think I learned anything of value in the lecture, I was always confused, and she would just talk about random stuff for an hour.  The final project was a complete disaster; no one was clear on what exactly we were supposed to do and what the entire point of the project was. The fact that it was initially supposed to be 60 pages is insane and I was never clear on what we were supposed to be doing until like week 9. Ulitmately, it felt like we were beinng used for Mendoza-Denton's personal research project, which was annoying. The only redeemable quality about this class was the TAs; they were actually helpful explaining topics, the project, reassuring us, and advocating for us (thank you Hannah Carlan). It's not the worst class if you're looking to get a decent grade, but don;t expect too much out of it."
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,F,"Bullshit class. Writing a final essay right now about a district in LA and how our urban planning affects the cultures there or some shit, and how that can be linked to their languages, cultures, etc. Can't even find info on google, where do you expect me to get this information. I'm a bisecon major I don't care about this stuff.  Take it if you want free time and an easy A but there's gonna be a little assignment that sucks ass every 2-3 weeks and a final paper that's gonna take me 3 hours to write but the topic is so boring its a drag."
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A+,"This class is fine. It was a fuckton of work; we had to go out to an LA neighborhood and interview a local to analyze the way they speak. It was a cool idea, but poorly structured. The professor isn't bad, but she didn't have any organization in her class. If you're an anthro buff, this is the class for you. If you're a normal person, I'd smash that pass button."
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,A,One of the easiest classes I have ever taken at UCLA.
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A," Honestly one of the easiest classes I have ever taken. Would HIGHLY recommend to anyone, especially science majors like myself because it takes no outside work and will be a perfect break with harder classes.  Going to class isn't necessary but I did every week because I felt bad that I wasn't doing any work outside of class. Largest assignment is 300 words weekly on something you need to skim. I had an amazing TA (HANNAH CARLAN), although I've heard pretty good things about all of the TA's, so take her if you can because she summarizes everything so well you literally only need to go to discussion to get an A.  Overall pretty interesting, TAKE THIS CLASS FOR AN EASY A."
Norma Mendoza-Denton,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"Norma's research is very interesting. After reading her book for the course, I realized how much of an expert she is in the field. She has contributed a lot to the Linguistic Anthropology field. Granted, if you don't have much interest in linguistics, you may not enjoy this class. There is a midterm, a final, two homework assignments, weekly reading responses, and your participation accounts for 30% of your grade. Overall, a smooth-running class. Read, do the homework, and participate in discussion section for an A."

Sherry B Ortner,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,N/A,"This was supposed to be a class on Sherpa culture.  It was, instead, Ortner's opinions on the philosophies of Marx, Geertz, etc.  Class time for questions was only allowed on the day that administrators visited the class to observe.  I gained nothing from this class except the headache of reading a very disorganized book.   I would not recommnd this instructor."
Sherry B Ortner,NA,Study of Social Systems,ANTHRO 140,B,"This is the worst class.  Your grade completely depends on the flexibility of your TA...Ortner is unengaging, monotone, and robotic in her instruction.  She does not podcast her lectures, and her ""slides"" include a couple of maps and a broad, overarching topic.  There are three extremely dense books required, and you have to post weekly summaries the Sunday before your next discussion.  I would highly recommend avoiding this class."
Sherry B Ortner,NA,Study of Social Systems,ANTHRO 140,B+," I'm going to share the facts in a list format:1) She could have been Jerry Seinfeld's mom2) She will assign three books for you to read, and your first thoughts are ""this can't be that bad"". The three books assigned were:Jocelyn Linnekin, Sacred Queens and Women of Consequence:  Rank, Gender, and Colonialism in the Hawaiian IslandsSherry B. Ortner, New Jersey Dreaming:  Capital, Culture, and the Class of ’58.Steven Gregory, The Devil Behind the Mirror:  Globalization and Politics in the Dominican Republic.Take a brief 30 minutes to checkout previews of these books before registering for the course. They are dense and you will be tested on every little bit of information on them.3)She will not cover any of the material from these three books in lecture. That is going to be left up to your TA to cover with you, in the limited amount of time allotted for discussion sessions. So it's pretty much left up to you to pick up on all of the testable information. 4)Ortner will use lecture instead to cover big picture topics such as neoliberalism, and the book by Gregory will be the ethnography for you to draw on for the topic, however she will NOT reference the book in any way, and that again will be the job of your TA to explain the connections. 5)So there are basically 5-6 professors for this class, depending on the team of TAs she uses your quarter, and each will have their own understanding of the connections made. If you and I have different TAs we will have a different understanding of the material for this class, and will receive different grades on the exams for the same amount of time spent studying. And that happened. According to a source, 34 students had their first exams regraded because of disputes with their TA about a lack of transparency on exam material. They were told to study one thing, and then were graded by the same TA on an entirely different rubric. When asked about the disparity in grading during lecture, Ortner said she has nothing to do with the grading, and to consult with the TAs about it. At the end, the regrades included test scores that went from C- to A, and others who thought they were unfairly graded but didn't receive a regrade. Imagine taking an exam you have studied really hard for, walking out of it expecting an A, and then getting slapped in the face with a C-. This didn't happen to me, since I was one of the lucky ones with who had a TA that was transparent and consistent about the information that would be testable, even though the TA was an extremely tough grader.  Those are the facts, and now here is my opinion:This is the worst anthropology class and CLASS you will register for in your entire lifetime. You see ""social systems"" and you assume it should be easy. Do not let the name fool you. This class has no consideration of the fact that you have other classes to read and study for. The exams are all in class essays that you will not have enough time to completely write. You will be provided a study guide, that once you have completed will be about 6 pages of single spaced information. You will have to memorize those 6 pages, because that will be the only way to get the A you want, otherwise you will fail while attempting to be creative on the spot. There just isn't enough time for you to respond to the multiple essay prompts off the top of your head. If you miss one word, or sentence that the TA is looking for, you will be docked points for it. Interestingly enough, since a study guide is provided, and it is your TA that will review the topics in the guides, it will be the information that your TA gives you that you end up studying, and not what you have from lecture notes. So basically you're being taught by someone else, who is also grading you, rendering Ortner's lectures a complete waste of life. Even scarier is the fact that if you end up using material from lecture to memorize, which your TA hasn't mentioned in the exam review, you might be docked points for it, if the TA was zoning out during lecture and didn't catch that point. I'm not sure if that was clear enough, but basically, you're being taught and graded by the TA.Ortner will not provide you will her slides that include bold topic names only, and instead she will read from pages that she has typed her lecture in. Dense information presented in a very dry and robotic manner, with no enthusiasm. She looks like she hates being up there and is ready for retirement. Looking at her lecture ruins your day, and your entire perspective on what being a professor should be. I am angry, not because I slacked off and didn't get the A I busted my ass for, but because of the inconsistencies in grading. A girl who had not previous record on file for having dyslexia got the same grade as me, only because she was smart enough to pull that card half way into the quarter after getting a shitty grade on the first exam. She bitched enough that the TA handed her the same grade I got, and this is simply unfair. This is my official warning to you, this class is not on an undergraduate level, you will hate life, UCLA, and question your abilities as a student after taking this class. You will end up with a grade that you don't deserve regardless of what the grade is. ""A"" students getting B's and C's, while C- are being regarded and graded to A's and B's. A horror story. You will ruin your GPA kid...Don't do it to yourself. Even if you need a theory course and it's your last quarter before graduation, wait, and take something else when it becomes available. DON'T DO IT!"
Sherry B Ortner,NA,Study of Social Systems,ANTHRO 140,N/A," I loved this class. One of the few classes in the anthropology department that is actually relevant to the real world, and makes you think about why things are the way they are.  I liked Ortner a lot. She can be a tad monotonous during lecture, but its obvious she is trying to phrase things in a way that are understandable since she's super smart. She's pretty funny, and even though I never talked to her, she feels warm and approachable. I would totally recommend her. There's a lot of reading, but it's doable.  Only critique...Make sure you get a decent TA for lecture. I've heard not so nice things about one of the female TAs this quarter."
Sherry B Ortner,NA,Study of Social Systems,ANTHRO 140,N/A," Ortner wasn't the worse professor ever, but she definitely wasn't the best.First off let me say, the tests are no longer take home, they are in class.Second it's pretty time consuming, you read 3 long books in 10 weeks, about 3/4 chapters per week. But I will give her this: she was very concerned with the students ability to grasp the material. She would pause often during lecture to take questions, which was kind of annoying when it meant we weren't able to leave 15 minutes earlier, but she did try to relate most of the topics to contemporary times. And she was pretty funny. Downside: She's not the best lecturer - instead of being clear and concise, she'll start her thought, then go off in a bit of a different direction, or her first sentence won't make sense so then she'd say it which I felt waste time. Or if she finally did say something that was clear, she'd continue on and on about that exact same thing. She really knew how to beat a dead horse."
Sherry B Ortner,NA,Study of Social Systems,ANTHRO 140,N/A," I had professor Ortner Winter 2012 for anthro 150 and it was by far my favorite class AND my first A.  Her tests are take home with a work count, but if you are precise you should be fine. I admit I got screwed because of the word count, but I still got a B on the midterm. The questions are STRAIGHT from lecture and discussion, so it's very important to go. I only missed one class (a first for me) and what she covered then was the only thing I missed on the exam.  Her lectures are sometimes dry, but very cohesive; if she ever went over, it was worth it because there goes another test question! If you think otherwise you just don't understand how she's organized the class to better suit the thinkers she covers.  For this quarter she changed things up though, so instead of articles you read three full length ethnographies- including her own, which was VERY funny and an easy read.Maybe this change is why the class was so much better compared to the person below me, but I had to comment (my first evaluation), because the class really was interesting and came in handy when I had to learn about Karl Marx this quarter! Take Ortner; she's a pint-sized, sassy lady. (If you talk she will catch you!)"
Sherry B Ortner,NA,Study of Social Systems,ANTHRO 140,N/A,"Ortner is a horrible professor.  Her tests are take home and the questions aren't hard but she puts a max word count on each question and its not enough to be able to properly answer the question making it impossible to do very well on the exams. She is incredibly rude during class, calling out students for talking when they were not, and keeping you past time then calling students rude for leaving while shes still talking even though class is over.  her lectures are horrible, she never finishes them. The topics she covers are in no way related to each other and they don't flow well. She touches on her subjects without properly explaining them. So you think you know the concepts but when you get the exams you realize that you don't know enough to be able to answer a question. She talks attendance in lecture and sections which is 20% of your grade. There were very few people that actually liked the class. I still don't know what I learned except that our generation is screwed. She uses the class to talk about herself and her work and how great she thinks she is. DO NOT TAKE THIS OR ANY CLASS WITH PROF ORTNER!!!"
Willemina Z Wendrich,NA,Ancient Egyptian Civilization,AN N EA M103A,A+," I found this class to be fun, however, it all depends on the TA. I recommend TA Nagy since she is caring to her students and genuinely tries to help you improve your overall grade. Note that I did take this class during the TA strike but overall it would have been the same amount of work. The class has weekly discussion w/ responses, 4-5 readings per week, a report of the notes on what you read per week, the weekly TA meeting, lecture videos, and a final (one informative slide of a topic of your choosing (project) w/ a full essay on the topic). I didn't talk to Professor Wendrich but she was really interested in the topic with her occasional Q&A zooms (make sure to participate by asking questions). Again, a lot of the talking comes from the TAs and they are essentially your Professor. Again, all depends on the TA you get. I know that my friend was a bit more worried than I was with assignments but still got an A.  I wish you luck!"
Willemina Z Wendrich,NA,Ancient Egyptian Religion,AN N EA M130,F,"there's just a lot of tedious busy work in this class. if you start early each week, then you will be fine. the readings are often really long and just repeat the async lecture videos, but you are expected to write at least 500 words for each reading (and there'll be 2-4 each week). this goes along weekly discussion responses and sometimes even more, such as the midterm and final projects. TAs grade a bit too harshly. you rarely ever get to interact with the professor since we only have 2 large zoom office hours (1 of which is cancelled due to the ta strike). class isn't really enjoyable in terms of content, but it's definitely easy if you just put in the effort"
Willemina Z Wendrich,NA,Ancient Egyptian Religion,AN N EA M130,F,Extreme amount of homework. More than any other class I've taken yet as a senior.
Willemina Z Wendrich,NA,Ancient Egyptian Religion,AN N EA M130,A-,This was by far the WORST class I have ever taken at a UCLA. The Professor is a joke and is extremely unhelpful. There is and INSANE amount of homework in this class and it is extremely boring. Do not recommend.
Willemina Z Wendrich,NA,Ancient Egyptian Religion,AN N EA M130,N/A,insane amount of homework; weekly reading journals (500-750 words per article) + weekly discussion posts. midterm was a short essay style test with 3 questions which we had a few days to submit. the final project is also a huge amount of work with like 3 different components. i wouldn't take this class unless i had to
Brian Wood,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Although the class itself isn’t horrible, the grading scheme is. The midterm is worth 40% of your grade as well as the final. I only took this class for my major and I would not take it again. The tests were very specific to the textbook and overall was too hard for what it should be. The professor was not bad but should take into consideration changing the grading scheme or even offering extra credit."
Brian Wood,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,B-," Like everyone has said, the overarching issue were the exams. Not only were they  80% of your grade, all the exams were super specific on content and it was just difficult overall to memorize everything all at once within a period of 10 weeks. There was also zero guidance on how to study for the exams. While the TA’s did have some worksheets available, most of it was really broad compared to the specificity on the tests. Additionally, Professor Wood read off his sixty plus slides for the majority of the lectures and made it really hard to stay alert during class.  However, Professor Wood was accommodating when people had COVID and was responsive when I emailed him about what I was dealing with. And without the TA’s, the course would have definitely been harder. I needed this course for my major but I highly recommend taking it online as I have heard that exams were open note, which would make your life 10x less stressful with all the information given. Overall, this class would have been better without his strict grading scheme. Content was interesting-ish LOL but wouldn’t recommend this as a GE."
Brian Wood,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,F," This class was way too hard for a GE. The midterm killed any chance at getting an A. Though it was open note, the questions were super specific and they were super nit-picky about the free-response ones. Like you had no idea what they actually expected you to write. The class was not engaging and it felt like being forced to watch a very boring YouTube video.  The professor and my TA definitely were knowledgeable on the subject. Perhaps my final assessment is that this would be a good class for someone genuinely interested in the subject, otherwise, you are bored and frustrated out of your mind. I cannot imagine taking this in person and having to memorize dates, primate teeth, digestive tracks, what kind of tools neanderthals used, and so forth. But if you're into that, this is the class for you."
Brian Wood,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A," The professor isn't terrible, but the strictness surrounding exams and grades was insane.  Professor Wood made it virtually impossible to take exams online, even when COVID-19 was running rampant through the student body.  I attempted to take the final exam online because I had come down with COVID-19 the day before, and I received no reply from the professor.  There were no make-up exams, and there were no online exams unless approved by the professor (and like I said, it was virtually impossible to get approved).  I, along with many others, ended up having to take the final exam while positive for COVID-19.  The entire lecture hall was coughing and sniffing, and though I do not fault anyone for coming in to take the exam seeing as we had no other choice, it was a horrible health hazard.   As for the grading scheme, the midterm average was 70%, and because one student scored 100%, there was no curve.  I do not know the average for the final exam, but I have heard that my classmates generally do not feel good about their grades. This grading scheme is far too harsh for a class many take as a GE."
Brian Wood,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A,"Honestly I know a lot of people complained about this class because of the fact that the midterm and final was basically all that you grade was made of but I honestly really liked it. My tip is if you are the type of person who thinks they don't need to do the reading or just doesn't feel like it, you probably won't get a good grade in the class. The final has a LOT of material that is covered in depth in the book. I found the readings interesting though. People in other comments also complained that there was no curve but he does adjust the grading scale so that a 88 is the minimum for an A and an 83 for an A- which I think is very fair."
Brian Wood,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,B,"Do not take this class as a regular GE, especially with Brian Wood. His voice is so monotone and boring. It seems like he doesn't even care about his students, especially because his office hours are shorter than the TA's. The course also has one midterm and one final that accounts for ~75% of the grade. If you bomb the first midterm, you have no chance in receiving a good grade in the class. He also gives no extra credit and tells everyone in the beginning in the class that this class isn't about effort, only material learned and memorized. Keep in mind he expects us to remember minute details from a 400 page textbook along with a long list (around 20 pages long) of fossil/primate characteristics. I feel like having a notecard available during the exams, splitting it into two midterms and a final, or making it open book would make this class more fair. ALSO, keep in mind the average grades were from when the exams were open note online during the pandemic. Would not recommend this class with Brian Wood, even though the topics are interesting."
Brian Wood,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Professor Wood was horrible, tests were worth 80% of your grade and were overly specific. I feel bad for anyone who takes this class as a GE"
Brian Wood,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A,"This class covers interesting material -- human evolution, archaeology, and primates. The class was offered in person, and both the midterm and the final were given in person. The class closely follows the textbook. As other students have commented, the final and the midterm were each worth 40% of the grade, which means you have to focus your efforts on studying the book to get an A in the class. One reviewer here said you could not take the midterm or the final online, but this is BS. You could definitely take either the final or the midterm online if you were not cleared to come to campus because of COVID symptom survey app. I took the final online because I had a positive COVID test. I know that many of us took the test online. This class is GE class but also a STEM class and there is lots of material to cover -- 7 million years of human evolution results in lots of findings."
Brian Wood,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,B+,"Professor Wood is the most boring prof I have had at UCLA yet. He reads directly off the speaker notes on his slides and is not enthusiastic about what he teaches. There is one midterm and one final, each worth 40% of your grade. The other 20% is easy to get full credit as it consists of discussion attendance and online inquisitive assignments. The tests were absolutely horrible. There is so much information covered in class, and he gives no guidance on what to study. It's all memorization but the content is so heavy it's impossible to remember everything. The class avg on tests was a C, and he did not curve because ONE person (out of hundreds) got a 100%. With tests being worth so much, even getting a B on the midterm makes it virtually impossible to get an A in the class. Tests were in person, and he made it extremely difficult to accommodate those positive for COVID. Overall worst class and professor I have taken."
Brian Wood,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,D,"This class is pretty easy, content is pretty much what you would expect taking an anthro evolution class. Except the grading is completely unfair. 40% midterm and 40% final would’ve been alright if there were two midterms to adjust an average score. I studied hours for this class because there’s no study guide, well they only provided one for the final which was literally pictures and just a chart (not helpful at all). Prof curved the grade based on highest overall grade but there’s always someone who aces the class so there’s essentially no curve. It’s just upsetting having aced stem courses but yet failed a GE. Make it make sense, change the grading scale or provide weekly quizzes or something for your next class won’t suffer. He’s a cool guy, but wasn’t understanding at all for everyone who emailed him about curving the grade for a good portion to not fail."
Brian Wood,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A," Honestly this class was time consuming. For me the lectures weren't as helpful as the textbook, just because the professor didn't get into the details of everything, but he expected you to know all these details for the exams.  Each week the professor went over two chapters. These chapters were definitely long but in the end when it came to the exams I found that since I read I already knew where to find most of my answers. I ended up getting an A- on both exams. The midterm free response was definitely graded more strictly than the final (thank goodness).  In addition to the lectures and readings, we had these online game-style quizzes that we had to complete. There were 3 levels to each quiz and you had to get a certain amount of points before reaching the next level. You definitely had to use the book to get through these (you aren't really penalized if you get wrong answers, it just takes you longer to finish the quiz). I found that if I read the chapter right before I took the quiz I was able to go through it much faster. Because the class grade is highly skewed towards what you get on the exams I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting 100% on all quizzes and in discussion section. This way if you get a lower A (like I did) on the exams you know you will at least get full points in the other areas.  Here is the breakdown of the course: Midterm: 40%Final Exam: 40%Inquizitive: 5%Discussion Section (short textbook questions): 15%  Overall, I didn't think this class was awful but like others said it would be super difficult to do in person because of all the details this course entails. I also think he made it much more detail oriented because we were online and the exams were open book, so it could be different in person! Shout out to Kim who provided notes for discussion section!"
Brian Wood,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A-,"Pass on this professor. While the class material is pretty simple (just memorization), Wood did a pretty bad job when it came to making and grading the exams. There are just weekly homework assignments, but they took a decent amount of time and were only work 5% of the grade overall. When it came to his exams, you could definitely tell he didn't revise them to make sure they made sense or were clear because he often had to send us emails DURING the exam to clarify what he meant because he would just exclude crucial pieces of information (luckily a bunch of kids would notice and have to email him during the exam so he could clear things up). He's the type of professor to have multiple right answers for multiple choice questions but ask you to choose the best one even if what he considers ""best"" doesn't align with the information in the textbook. He also had to tell us if the information in his lectures didn't match up with the textbook, then we should trust the textbook, which was a hassle bc then we would always have to double check his slides and lectures, which took up a lot of time. The questions seem easy but it's like he purposely messes with the wording to make it more confusing since it's the only way to make the material difficult. I would have rather had more difficult material with straightforward testing. My advice: choose a different professor if you have the chance."
Brian Wood,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A+,"I took this class as a major requirement and really had no real interest in the material. That said, there were a few things that I thought were really interesting despite my lack of initial interest. Dr. Wood is really a great professor and he worked really hard to make this learning environment accessible to everyone this quarter. An 84% was an A, the final was optional, and discussion sections were really relaxed and flexible. My TA, Brit, was the best!! We had weekly discussion homework graded on completion, participation based on attendance, and weekly online homework (similar to launchpad). I got a 99% on the midterm and did not choose to take the final. The class is definitely doable, I just thought it was dry because I wasn't really interested in it. Dr. Wood had to take a leave of absence mid-quarter for personal reasons but Dr. Selza took over around week 5 and was just as great:) There were a lot of challenges this quarter but all the professors and TAs were really flexible and understanding."
Brian Wood,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A,"I really enjoyed this class. At first, his prerecorded lectures were surpassing class time and it was taking me forever to go through them, but it was worth it in the end. We had these weekly quizzes that you can do until you get a 100% (through Inquizitive), we had weekly discussions that were really helpful, and we had awesome TA's. The class's grade divisions was very helpful and in the end the final became optional (over an 84 was an A). The midterm, though, had to work on it a lot and got a fair grade. Even though there's a lot of talk about different types of primates and comparing them to humans, I learned a lot and was a cool subject I was never introduced to before! Enroll in this class!!"
Brian Wood,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A," This review is for Spring 2020, the first COVID-19 remote learning quarter. The textbook should be free and provided through Norton. Think of it as similar to LaunchPad, but a bit better. At the end of the chapters, you'll also be assigned to Inquizitives which is basically interactive quizzes that you need to take about the chapter you just read. Good thing is that you can keep on answering questions until you get 100%.  Don't sweat about this. The midterm was a bit tough and some parts were ambiguous, but they were open note and open book. They were a combo of MC and short answers. Discussions are mostly just the TA talking about the week's content and filling out some short worksheet. We were tossed into some break out rooms, but no big deal. If you have taken the LS series, there will be some themes that are extremely similar to LS7B (Hardy-Weinberg, genetics, etc) and ecology as well. I didn't bother taking the optional final because for Professor Wood, the breakdown was an 84%+ was an A and had scored a 99 on the midterm.  Please keep in mind that this review is in the context of the circumstances of this quarter! Overall, a great class and I learned to appreciate and love primates."
Erica Cartmill,NA,Selected Topics in Biological Anthropology,ANTHRO 129,A,"A great professor, I really enjoyed her class.  Wasn't too interested into biological anthropology but she made it fun.  There is one paper but it's not that hard. Her review sessions are really useful as well !"
Erica Cartmill,NA,Language Development and Socialization,ANTHRO M152P,A-,"I took this class during the quarantine, so my review may be different from other reviews.When the class began, the professor seemed so nice. The lectures and discussions were fun and engaging, then the midterm came. The MIDTERM was supposed to take 2 HOURS MAXIMUM, but it took me 6 HOURS. The class average was over 8 hours and the professor did not really care about it. After a lot of complaints, (and I think someone talked to the department head), she just changed. She became very helpful and understanding. She gave us extra credit, replaced the lower grade for the test with the higher test, and gave a much easier final. In the end, I kinda liked her. It was her first time in online teaching so she might not have known the difficulties, but overall, she deserves a higher rating than 2.4 (her rating was 2.4 when I wrote this review)"
Erica Cartmill,NA,Language Development and Socialization,ANTHRO M152P,B,"Took this class during Spring 2020, and her midterm and final were half short answer and half essay questions. She said it was supposed to take 2 hours total, but the class averaged 8 hours taking the exams. We tried to explain our situations during the pandemic but she was unreasonable and uncompromising of our issues. Do not take this class, especially if it is online."
Erica Cartmill,NA,Language Development and Socialization,ANTHRO M152P,A+,disregard any of the past bad reviews if you are taking this class in person. I was scared because of all the bad reviews but I loved this class and thought the professor was great. All the assignments are manageable and the exams are not difficult if you study (and they typically include extra credit questions). I found the topic super interesting and really enjoyed going to lecture
Erica Cartmill,NA,Language Development and Socialization,ANTHRO M152P,A-,"I took this class during the pandemic and honestly I think people who are leaving negative reviews are overexaggerating. Yes, the midterm did take longer than the recommended 2 hours, but it was not the hardest test I've ever taken. The test was shortened due to the pandemic and she made things really clear during office hours. Others in the class felt like it was ""the hardest midterm they've ever taken at UCLA"" but it really was not. It was really fairly straightforward, 3 short answers, and 3 long answers. She posted lecture videos instead of live lectures so I just put them on 2x speed and took notes. Overall, the class was pretty interesting and she was a really good professor and made the content pretty clear."
Erica Cartmill,NA,Language Development and Socialization,ANTHRO M152P,F,"Professor Cartmill seemed genuinely interested and knowledgeable about the topic, but she was just not willing to be helpful and accommodating to students. This class was so frustrating because she kept acting like she wanted to help us, but then refused to listen to any of our suggestions. She insisted that our midterm (which if you added up word count would be 2000 words) was doable in 2 hours in class, which is straight up a lie, and when we suggested that we be given more time to do it, or that we have fewer questions, she would tell us that she wouldn't do that and to stop asking. The material wasn't even particularly challenging, but she told us she wanted to ""challenge and push"" us and make it hard for us, resulting in confusing and misleading questions on the exams. Her lectures were also consistently late to be uploaded, and she wasn't the best at communication. Again, I get that going online was hard for everyone, but she demanded that we adapt quickly while asking us to make allowances for her. I think most people ended up getting As and Bs, but it was overall not a great experience."
Erica Cartmill,NA,Language Development and Socialization,ANTHRO M152P,A,"I'm sure Professor Cartmill is a lot more organized in an in-person lecture format that she is more used to, but for online classes, her readings & lectures were consistently days late to be uploaded. I never knew when a lecture was up, and felt stupid doing the readings because they were all covered during the lecture, with no extra information presented to serve as an incentive to pay attention to lecture. That being said, the readings are important for the exams, because it's reading-heavy and you are required to cite sources. I took this as an elective as a linguistics major, but I wish I took something else because I didn't really learn anything I hadn't already learned in past linguistics courses. Definitely a good source of information for non-linguistics majors interested in language acquisition/socialization though!"
Erica Cartmill,NA,Language Development and Socialization,ANTHRO M152P,B,Im writing this review crying while taking a break from doing this 12 HOUR FINAL. Dont take this class y'all. I hate it here. Her tests take hours and I'm just at my breaking point with all this work and the pandemic/ racial protests. This class made me HATE this subject. Im so tired. Im so over it. Idk why she has to go all out on her tests when everyone is having a hard time rn. I just wanna cry and never look at another transcript again. Please do yourself a favor and take a different class with a professor who actually cares about you and your wellbeing.
Erica Cartmill,NA,Language Development and Socialization,ANTHRO M152P,B+,"Took this class in the middle of a Pandemic and racial injustice protests - mentally this was a tough class to get through. What made it worse is she just seemed to not care. She would give us approximate times it would take to finish an assignment, but would totally miss the mark. For example, she gave us an essay format midterm with short and long answers that was supposed to take 2 hours to complete - the class averaged 8 hours. We sent her an email and she complained about it... but we were supposed to be patient with her posting late lectures. She obviously knows her stuff when it comes to the course and the content was very interesting, but her attitude completely rubbed me the wrong way."
Erica Cartmill,NA,Language Development and Socialization,ANTHRO M152P,A,"Prof. Cartmill is very knowledgable about the subject material and explains course concepts well. However, she did not take care to assist us taking this class online during a pandemic. Our exams (half short answer, half essay) and homework assignments (transcript notations and short answers) took longer to complete than she said. When the class asked her about it, she complained and was uncompromising about our issues. The course content is very interesting but organization of the class online during a pandemic made it not worthwhile."
Marta L De gerdes,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"Anthro 33 was basically an easy class.  The reading material was not too interesting to me, but as I got more into it, I found value in it.  As far as Professor De Gerdes, I found her to be an ineffective teacher.  Her lectures were very disorganized and I found it difficult to relate them to the readings.  I attended every lecture and for the most part stayed up on my readings so I'd like to say that I did not attribute to the problem.  Towards the end of the year I found her to be a little immature and hostile towards the TA's for some reason.  She is only a guest lecturer so I don't think many people will have her but if you have the choice for Anthro 33, take another prof."
Marta L De gerdes,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A," I'm very pleased that she's only a visiting professor who will not be coming back for next quarter. Here is the breakdown as to what her class consisted of: -the reading assignments were interesting, for the most part.-her lectures were off topic and she didn't state the important points enough-she teaching style is very unorganized-she exhibits the maturing of a nine year-old-her exams are easy, the study guide is concise-the fieldwork was fun, although sometimes you didn't need to know anything about anthro to do well on the assignments.-the TA's were really understanding of the students and our inability to ""get"" her. I don't suggest her as a professor, but I do recommend the class. The class was pretty easy and in the end I'm not upset I took the class with her."
Marta L De gerdes,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A," gerdes is an excellent professor!  Her lectures are exicting and inticing.  The information she presents is not only rich with content, but they make an individual want to become an anthro linguist.  I would highly recommend Gerdes's classes to any individual who is interested in the anthrolinguistic field.  Everyone knows that her critics are the people who are failing her class. "
Marta L De gerdes,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"Professor de Gerdes is alright if you don't mind boring lectures and the way she puts down everyone else around her, including her own T.A.s. She may have a softspoken demeanor but after a while you will realize she can be unreasonably unpleasant and rude. She was extremely rude to one T.A. whom she apparently didn't like in front of the whole class on more than one occasion and once almost had a fight with a student during lecture which started because they tried asking her a question about the final."
Marta L De gerdes,NA,Culture and Communication,ANTHRO 4,N/A,"prof. de gerdes isnt that bad of a professor. although her lectures do tend to get a little boring sometimes.  but i will say this, her class is one of the easiest ge's.  midterm consisted of like 10 multiple choice questions, 5 fill in the blanks, and two one page essays.  all the terms, and essays are given to u about a week in advance, so there are no suprises.  final is basically the same format.  there were three group projects that were very tedious, but they were an easy way to get free points towards your grade.  in general, just take the class it doenst have that difficult of examinations and the reading is very little."
Marta L De gerdes,NA,Ethnography of Everyday Speech,ANTHRO 151,N/A,"Proffessor deGerdes is boring, plain and simple. she assigns a phenominal amount of reading, which would be more rewarding if she were better at teaching it. otherwise, its just a phenominal amount of reading. She knows how to make interesting things not interesting. Don't take her classes."
Russell Thornton,NA,Repatriation of Native American Human Remains and Cultural Objects,ANTHRO C144S,N/A,"Professor Thornton is not a terrible professor like how the last reviewer claimed, but he doesn't have a youthful nature especially during his lectures. He tends to be monotone when he is lecturing and shows a lot of slides and videos from his work with the Smithsonian Institute and UCLA repatriation committee. The whole course focuses on the 2 acts and amendment passed to repatriate Native American remains and artifacts to their affiliated tribes or descendants. If this class sounds interesting to you, then you'll enjoy it. If it doesn't, you are going to be extremely bored for 10 weeks. However, this course is incredibly easy. Your grade is based on 20% for attendance and 80% for your take home final. There is no way you can fail..."
Russell Thornton,NA,Native North Americans,ANTHRO 160A,N/A,"Thornton focuses his midterm and final on lecture. Make sure to take good class notes. Only a small fraction of the tests are taken from the textbooks. With that being said, he is an excellent and very kind professor. He or the TA grade very leniently and are very available for help. Take him if you could. "
Russell Thornton,NA,Native North Americans,ANTHRO 160A,N/A,"Professor Thornton is one of the most down to earth, likable, and genuinely kind professors I have encountered in my 4 years at UCLA. He is not the most engaging lecturer, but he knows what he's talking about and is so nice that he makes you want to listen to him. The class is not difficult. Skim the reading, pay attention, and you'll be fine. Take Thornton. He is seriously the nicest guy that will make you feel like you can finally exhale when you walk into his class. "
Russell Thornton,NA,Native North Americans,ANTHRO 160A,N/A," Easy!  Nice guy! The TA was very helpful, Eric Fries. "
Russell Thornton,NA,Change and Continuity among Native North Americans,ANTHRO 160B,A+," Professor Thornton is easily the BEST professor I've had at UCLA. Although the subject material can sometimes be a bit dry, he always tells you exactly which topics will be on the exams. Professor Thornton is incredibly knowledgable and often shares his own relevant experiences with the class, usually from his time as the director of the Smithsonian repatriation committee. If you show up to class and pay attention most of the time, you will do really well in this class (and 172A). Both classes are graded solely on the midterm (40%) and final (60%), but Professor Thornton grades very generously, and most people get A's in his classes."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,F,"Do not take this class. Manson is extremely unaccommodating and his lectures are impossible to follow. He was extremely rude to his students when they requested an only version of one of the midterms (due to concerns about the pandemic, immunocompromised students, international students living in their home countries, etc). It is pretty ironic that he spends so much time studying humans considering he does not care about his students. In terms of the class material, his lectures make no sense, are organized terribly, and are even worse in person. He obviously is educated on what he is teaching but it makes no sense to students without a deep background in evolution. Overall, I would never recommend this class to anyone, ever."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A,"I genuinely liked this class and found Professor Manson to be fair. The tests required a lot of memorization but he did give study guides for them and all the test questions seemed to be taken straight from them. A lot of people were upset that he made the second midterm and final in person but in multiple of my other classes the professors did the same exact thing and no one complained so I don't know what it was with this class. I would definitely recommend this class, as it made me think more critically and I even found myself telling my friends fun facts that I learned during the quarter."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A-,"Upon first reading Manson’s syllabus, I knew he’d be an interesting character due to his policy on no extra credit and a disclaimer about free speech in his class. This class was half in the Covid setting because of the Omicron resurgence, and half in person starting in February. I didn’t like following along the PowerPoint audio slides because this gave me hours and hours of notes to write at a clunky speed. I did appreciate the online midterm format which was fair and ensured that questions could not simply be searched online. In person, Manson is a decent lecturer but goes a bit fast — I personally had to touch up on many notes later. He was pretty sassy, and wrote emails with plenty of snark whenever us students petitioned for anything. In person, his exams are memorization based so definitely grind out those slides. My TA was Damanjit, a very refreshing and relatable guy. Take this class with Manson if you want decent exams and don’t care about the professor. Godspeed to anyone memorizing the fossil chart — it’s easier to teach a monkey how to steal food."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,F,"manson is extremely unaccommodating and rude. the material itself is fine and the tests are as well, but the professor is what ruined this class for me completely."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A-," I managed in this class, but I didn't enjoy it at all. The grades were pre-curved. You only needed like 84% to get an A. This mattered a lot because the exams were extremely difficult in my opinion. In addition, I found it hard to learn in lecture because Manson simply didn't speak clearly or present things in an interesting manner. He was also rude to numerous students over the course of the quarter.  In sum, the class was an easy A, but it was miserable to get through."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A,"As per prior reviews, this professor is not accommodating at all. I would not take this professor even if 84 is an A. An 84 is an A in his class because his tests are crazy. The lectures, homework, and discussions were straight forward and easy to understand but is not reflective of what he is going to put on the exams (which are 85% of your grade). The general topics of Anthro 1 are not hard but the way he tests stuff is so miniscule you might as well memorize every single thing he says. He provides a study guide but I felt like although it gives students a sense of what is going to be tested on, it does not prepare students of the miniscule detail on his exams. He also added test questions probably from our textbooks so you might as well breathe the anthro textbook. This class was not that difficult and the material was interesting towards the latter half of the course, it just sucks that these tests are a memorizing test than a comprehension test. It was hard to even connect some questions to the more general topics on our final because of how miniscule the details of the questions were."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,F," Take this class. One reason we go to college is to get a good job, and another reason is to learn more about ourselves and the world. My whole life I had been concerned that selflessness was weakness, but this class showed me that our uniquely human ability to self-sacrifice for others, even strangers, may actually be one of our greatest strengths. How can we conclude that? Prof. Manson walks us through the scientific method, natural selection, our distant ancestors--he shows us how humans came to be. This is a North campus class, but really it is an ode to science. It is firm in its belief that we can grasp meaning from the world through scientific approaches, that there are powerful things to learn from a worldview centered around skepticism. I think that, at heart, Prof. Manson is a romantic. His lectures glow with enthusiasm. He answers questions with the same joy that people open birthday presents. This is someone who has long since discovered what his passion is, and who wants to share that passion with you. Other students have criticized him for making us take our second midterm in person, saying that he did not accommodate international students, students with disabilities, or immunocompromised students. But he did accommodate them. There was an option to not take the second midterm, and have the final count for more. For students unable to take the final, he gave options to take the final on another date, depending on the needs of the student. Call me cynical, but I think the actual reason people were angry about the in-person midterm is that in-person exams are harder. They require we memorize things. So yes, take this class with Prof. Manson. I love UCLA, but one flaw with our school is that our classes focus too much on getting us jobs. Anthro 1 with Manson feels like a class from a liberal arts college. I promise that if you engage with the material, at the end of the 10 weeks you'll be able to think about yourself and the rest of the world more thoughtfully."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,F,"Overall I guess it's important to take into account that Manson is a pretty standard/traditional teacher, our class materials include powerpoints with voice-overs as well as a textbook(Manson purposefully picked an edition that was both recent and cost-efficient so Thank you!). The class is formatted in a way that provides everything you need to achieve a good grade and learn a lot. You can tell he doesn't necessarily care for straying from his plans even if it risks likability ex: while in remote learning, despite student/TA requests, there were no zoom lectures with Manson (other than office hours), when requested to provide an online format of the second midterm and final, Manson declined. For the no zooming, I'm trying to be understanding and reason with others that he's only human, not everyone wants to be on zoom for hours, maybe he gets anxious in that kind of setting. Whatever the case may be, it would have been nice for us but not necessary. As a student with concerns about the pandemic, the response to the student's reasoning was a bit alarming, however, I also understand his viewpoint for wanting to uphold the integrity of the course and follow the administration's instructions. Overall the course is pretty simple, following his lectures in person is much easier than remote, but studying on your own/with peers is ideal. Seems like a funny guy(in a sarcastic/way), you can tell he cares about what he teaches which makes it a bit more interesting. Though he isn't necessarily accommodating, he is pretty helpful."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A,"Although I was happy to have a GPA boost, I was saddened by the lack of effort Professor Manson put into this class. I wish he posted lecture recordings where we could see his face rather than just posting powerpoints because, especially during COVID-19, studying from the uploaded slides alone made this class feel like a waste. Also, don't buy the textbook because even though he says it's fair game for the tests, he uses different wording from the textbook and can deduct points from your tests sometimes if you word something in a way that is too far removed from the slides."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A,"Manson's a pretty serious dude and and he makes lectures so much harder to get through. His study guides are long. His tests are fair, only because he doesn't test outside of the study guide. I will say that I do feel like I walked away with a solid foundation in bio anthro, but would not recommend if you're looking for an easy/fun GE"
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,C+," Professor Manson was great. He was clear and gave us a fair chance to do good on his exams. I took this class as a freshman when I still didn't know time management so I would always try to complete and study the study guides only a few days before the exams. Bad idea. The study guides are long and require in depth answers but complete it with a friend, quiz each other, and you should be fine. The exams were exactly like the study guides. Of course not everything was covered which made it stressful when studying. For example, you got 50 study guide questions but only 25 would be on it. So study EVERYTHING on the study guides. If i had studied on time, i definitely would have gotten a much better grade. Selling the textbook:9780393936773 It's pretty expensive. $160 New at the UCLA store. Selling for $100 flat.  That's less than the used price in store. It's basically in brand new condition. Doesn't even look like it's been used cuz let's be real. As a freshman I didn't think it would be necessary but it definitely is.  Text: (424) 204-2951 :-)"
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A,"Professor Manson was super helpful inside and outside the class. He posted his slides, the class was Bruincasted, AND he gave in depth study guides for all of the tests. Nothing appeared on the tests that wasn't on the study guide.  Discussion was mandatory and there were little homework assignments every week, but as long as you tried  the TA pretty much gave you 100%. Super easy class and actually really interesting. I'd recommend going to his office hours, he's a really fascinating guy. He doesn't give extra credit and his tests aren't curved, but the grade cut off for an A is like 85%. You'd really have to try to do bad in this class. I wish I could take this class with him again."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A+,"As HBS taking this class for my major (I'm a 3rd year), this was by far one of the easiest, and most engaging classes I have taken. Professor Manson is clear with his lectures, especially since he gives out study guides with questions that explicitly frame the content needed to study for the exams. I have yet to see a professor who has written up such study guides for a class. The textbook is helpful in not only presenting the material in a different way, but also giving further examples for the concepts Professor Manson presents in class. He is a great lecturer, gives apt examples, posts his slides online, and is a very fair professor. One concept in class, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, is even taught in a way to encompass students coming from all sorts of backgrounds - those in south AND north campus. If you need help, go to your TAs or his OH. His OH are often empty, yet so welcoming not only to questions regarding the course, but also questions expanding on anything related."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,B+,"He gives a study guide before each midterm and the final. THERE IS A PRE-SET CURVE AT 84%. I'm really not sure why Prof Manson has such bad reviews, the class was pretty easy if you studied and took notes. Very interesting also. Do the study guides and give yourself a couple days to study and you'll be fine. Just need to be very specific/detailed on tests/ make sure to study the fossil charts. You have 2 online quizzes each week (worth 5% of your grade) where you can keep answering questions until you get 100%. Section attendance/participation/homework is worth 15%. So you have a pretty easy 20%. Midterms are worth 25% each (there are 2) and final is worth 30%. Overall, not a hard class and the professor is really nice."

Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,B-,Honestly dont take this class unless it is required for your major. This professor made the class unnecessarily hard for no damn reason. I am a human biology pre major and although i was able to do well in my other classes my lowest grade came from his class. Midterm is HARD ASF and its 40% of the grade long answer short answer and multiple choice. Final is the same but longer. They take off points for almost everything its bad. there are quizzes every week online and its worth 5% of the grade and then the rest of the points is for discussion which you have to go to to turn in homework. Do not take this class with this professor trust me it went from my easy A to my hardest class
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A,"This class, both the lectures and subject matter, were boring but easy. The lectures were just a regurgitation of the textbook, and while organized and clear, they weren't super engaging. A lot of the material was evolution, so take this class if you're interested in learning about evolution for the millionth time. Also we talked a lot about all the different kinds of monkeys, which was less interesting than you would think."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,This class was way harder than it needed to be. His lectures are extremely boring. Take this class with another professor. Trust me. 
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"This class was not that bad. My favorite parts were the homework assignments that had all the answers online (just Google the question and it'll come up) and the fact that he used Bruincast. I was able to put off this class in favor of other non-GE classes the whole quarter, except 5th week and finals week. Some of the stuff is extremely dull and other parts are pretty interesting, but nothing too hard. I do think the tests were graded kind of harshly, but the scale for final grades is generous. I got 78% on both the midterm and the final, 100% on the discussion and got an A-. I would recommend answering every single question on his study guide with a paragraph, because everything on there is fair game for the tests. He is extremely approachable in office hours, just don't expect to have anything regraded. The class is not bad, just a LOT of memorization."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A," Prof. Manson is super nice & knowledgable; it is clear that he cares about this subject as well as his students.  However, it was a definite struggle to pay attention throughout each and every lecture.  I printed the slides beforehand and jotted down some notes as he talked.  I'd say either go to lecture or read the textbook; if you do at least one you will be good.  Most helpful tip: put all your energy in the study guides when studying for the midterm and final (he tells you what lectures and textbook page numbers to look at for the answer to each).  I spent hours answering each question with at least a paragraph. The tests themselves seemed sooo easy after putting so much effort in the study guides"
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"This class isn't bad. It's all memorization. There's weekly homework assignments that are pretty easy, a midterm and a final. Use the book, the podcasts, and the slides he posts to do the study guides. If you know the study guides, you'll be fine. Oh yeah, and study the diagrams he gives as part of the study guides because he definitely tests you on them. You don't need to go to lecture or take too many notes because the class is podcasted and he posts the slides."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"I am a fourth year, biochem, with a GPA of 3.6 and he gave a C-.I feel insulted. His midterm and final was too hard.His ""fairness"" doctrine in terms of grading is very unfair.Because of him, I may not be getting my cum laude. Thank you Prof Manson."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Professor Manson was a really caring and concerned professor.  Although the final and midterms were difficult, this man is so passionate about what he teaches.  Based on my ta, I would say the discussions are quite pointless. All my discussion did was go over the homework and it was very ineffective.  However, seeking extra help from Manson in office hours (especially after he distributes the study guides for his midterm and final) is SOOO helpful! It really saved my grade in that class because the TAs grade so hard on the midterm and final.  If you feel you deserved a higher score because the TAs grade to harsh, definitely talk to the professor. Hes really reasonable and way more fair than any of the TAs.  I got an A and I really didn't find the class difficult.  The lecture turn out is horrible, but maybe all the lectures I attended kept me in that A range. Best advice: Go to office hours and go to lecture--its the difference between an A and a B.  "
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,really interesting class...book is a light read. not too bad at all. his lectures are very boring and i barely ever went to class but they slides are all online and the lectures are podcasted. just make sure you listen to them! midterm and final are not hard at all...i did study a lot but his slides prepare you well and completely follow the book. Just make sure you do the study guide! Memorize the answers to your questions and you'll be fine. His test questions reflect those answers. Not bad at all...I would definitely recommend this class.
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"The midterm and final were difficult, but if you obviously take the time to study very hard and MEMORIZE everything, then it's fairly easy to get an A.  However, I really did not like his lectures; he's extremely boring and just reads from his lecture slides.  He tries to be funny, but he's really not.  Plus, he made us purchase $20-40 dollars worth of this stupid device to take in-lecture quizzes, which ultimately failed because of the bad internet connection in Haines.  Basically he just gave up after 3 tries and ended up giving everyone full credit.  I highly suggest taking this class with another professor!"
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"I like the way he teaches in his lectures. I also like the discussions because they are somewhat effective; however, the midterm and the final are very hard since it is not based on the readings nor on the lectures, and his method of fairness is not fair: ""based on your overall performance towards the class"". He may seem to be fair on the syllabus but if you stop and think that why do 10% of the class will always get an A and 15% of the class always a B is not quite fair. If you plan to take this class, with this professor be ready for the GPA downbooster."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,There is a lot of memorization!  It was somewhat difficult to know what to study for because a lot of the material was controversial.  What helped me was making a study guide for all the theories and concepts he went over in class as well as making a chart for all the hominids/hominins.  When he lists points of what a certain theory consists of... make sure you know the points and be able to describe them!
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"class is easyhowever, the midterm and the final are horrible. they are just impossible. you think you did well on the tests, however the scores you get are horrendous.ta sections are really helpful."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"do not take this class. the grading on the tests make no sense at all, they want specifics and if you get too specific you dont get the points. hes a nice guy and he will try to help but sadly his dimwit ta's are the ones who grade the tests."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"To be honest, I hated this class, might have been my least favorite one in my time here at UCLA. A combination of very dry material, difficult tests that I really wasn't sure how to study for, and the worst lectures that I've ever been in. Sorry, I'm sure he's a good guy and really enjoys what he does, but I didn't take anything away from this class."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,The class isn't that difficult BUT you do have to do a lot of memorization of his lecture notes. Read the book if you have time and want to understand what he's talking about. He is very dry in lectures but if you go and read the notes you should get an A.
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Prof Manson isn't the most exciting guy, but the class was fairly interesting. The midterm and final have questions on them directly from the study tests which makes the class pretty easy. Go to lectures and stay awake, and I can't see how you won't get an A."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Easiest A I had at UCLA.  Just stay awake and that A is assured.  Also, his lecture notes were word-for-word what he said in class.  This is a class to take."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Survey of Biological Anthropology,ANTHRO 120,A,"Anthro 120 was a small class (around 15 students)  and enrollment is only possible through PTE numbers for his class. There are no in class midterms of finals for this class and you're grade boils down to participation/attendance, a final paper, a take-home final, and leading a few discussions throughout the quarter. Every class session is pretty much the same, with Professor Manson assigning one reading for the day and the class then submits 1 question about the reading to the professor, which he then compiles and sends to the students who will be leading the discussion on the day that the reading is to be discussed. Basically, you need to have the reading done 3 days before the actual day you discuss the reading in class. The take home paper and take home final are not bad at all, just make sure you read throughout the quarter. Professor Manson really wants students to give their opinion and perspective and is very engaging. By no means does he lecture or ramble nor does he belittle  you in any way. I took this as a Bio elective and you do learn a lot about human behavior, primates, and evolution. Not a heavy workload at all."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Survey of Biological Anthropology,ANTHRO 120,N/A,"I actually really liked Professor Manson. He is smart, approachable, and held interesting sections. The material that he assigns is difficult, but not impossible. For our class, he gave nearly-weekly pop quizzes on the readings which I thought were pretty fair. As long as you participate in discussions and actually pay attention to the material (and I don't know, maybe even learn a few things), you should be fine."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Survey of Biological Anthropology,ANTHRO 120,N/A,"He was an awesome professor. It was a small class so he knew everyone pretty well. He is extremely approachable. The reading were dense, and he knew this, but he did his best in leading the discussions in the class as smoothly as possible. He likes when you participate and give your opinion, in no way does he make you feel bad for stating something that is irrelevant. He encourages student participation as much as possible. Pop-quizes throughout course, but definitely not difficult. One research paper that he allows you to choose your own topic, not difficult at all. Got an A in the class. I recommend taking him! "
Joseph H Manson,NA,Evolution and Biology of Human Behavior,ANTHRO 124,N/A,omg! do not take w/ 124 w/ manson! maybe for anthro 7 he knows his stuff...but...124...he pauses so much in his lecture my thoughts drift away...i don't understand much of what he is saying and i hate this class
Joseph H Manson,NA,Animal Communication,ANTHRO M128Q,N/A," Professor Manson is clearly very intelligent, very approachable, and very organized. He is diligent about keeping students updated with posted material (lecture slides, etc.) and even sends out study guides before exams. As long as you know the material on the study guide really well, you will be fine for the exams even if it seems like lectures and readings cover a lot of material. Don't get me wrong, the material isn't easy. But it's not all that hard either. If you enjoy learning about evolutionary principles (specifically regarding communication), this class if for you. We all like professors who give us easy work and give us easy grades, but I'm glad I worked throughout the quarter and that I was challenged (but not too much) with the material. I always had trouble staying awake during lectures since I go to bed so late every night, but the fact that podcasts are posted online made things all the more easier. Quizzes are given almost weekly but they are really not all that difficult and some of those questions even appear on the exams, so that's a plus. Take Manson. I'd be taking him again if I was an anthro major."
Joseph H Manson,NA,Animal Communication,ANTHRO M128Q,N/A,"The class was not too hard. However you cannot just get by without doing anything. The midterm and final were extremely fair because he gives you a study guide to prepare for it. The lectures can be a little dry and boring, but he always posts them online which helps a lot. The professor is fairly good, however the topic ""Animal Communication"" was somewhat misleading. I guess I was expecting another method of the theories, but it mainly invovled evolutionary principles and lots of examples, but yeah I guess it is about communication. I have to final Tuesday and I would recommend this class, you do learn a lot."
Lothar von Falkenhausen,NA,Medieval Art,ART HIS 51,N/A," I took Chinese Art with him in the Fall. He's unfortunately boring and pauses a lot when he speaks. The readings for this class were a bit excessive, but it was overall doable for me. Technically, you COULD miss lecture, but just to secure the A, it's great to write down everything he says. I was able to get an A in this class (make sure to consult with the TAs about the essays, by the way), but I would not recommend it. I had to memorize 50+ paintings (including the artist name, time period, and title), which is just not worth all the time.  Overall: interesting subject, boring professor, possible to get an A with standard effort."
Lothar von Falkenhausen,NA,Art of India and Southeast Asia,ART HIS 56A,N/A,This class is very easy. Winter 2011 quarter is taught by him and another professor. There is no need to read the book if you can stay awake during lecture! His accent is very thick but understandable. Awesome class overall
Lothar von Falkenhausen,NA,Chinese Art,ART HIS 56B,C+,"I've taken a lot of classes with a lot of professors and I do not say this lightly when I say this guy is the scum of the Earth. Worst professor ever. Should have his position revoked. Basically gave everyone in the class a C for this bullsh*t GE class. Boring, uninspiring, confusing, super thick accent, and his TA's are complete assh*les.. AVOID THIS MAN AS IF YOUR LIFE DEPENDED ON IT PLEASE!!!!!"
Lothar von Falkenhausen,NA,Chinese Art,ART HIS 56B,N/A,"I took this class fall quarter of my freshman year and I almost never went to lecture, just discussion. I got a B+ with minimal effort.  Maybe it was because I took AP Art History in high school or that my TA was awesome (Julia). Anyway, when I did go to lecture I almost always fell asleep or didn't pay attention- soooo boring and I'm an Art History major.  If you want this for an interesting GE or requirement for your major you have to bank on getting a good TA or else it will be a really boring class."
Lothar von Falkenhausen,NA,"Art and Material Culture of Early Imperial China, 210 B.C. to A.D. 906",ART HIS C115E,A,"Professor von Falkenhausen is honestly one of the nicest, best professors I've had at UCLA. Not only is he extremely understanding of students personal lives and willing to be flexible with your needs, he's a very fair grader and very straightforward with what he's looking for in assignments. His exams are fair, and you only have one per quarter, which gives you tons of time to do the readings. He was always available for students to reach out to for help and I've never had a professor email me back so quickly! You have one final paper and he gives you the entire quarter to prepare, and you can reach out to him to have him read your drafts and give you comments before submitting it. He's also really passionate about what he teaches, which you can feel in lecture. I would most definitely take a class with him again and for anyone taking an Art His class I would strongly recommend him."
Lothar von Falkenhausen,NA,"Art and Material Culture of Early Imperial China, 210 B.C. to A.D. 906",ART HIS C115E,N/A,"Excellent professor.  Just make sure to request that he reads your papers, not the TA."
Scott M Pletka,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A," This class was the most boring class I have ever taken at UCLA.  The professor was very arrogant and pretentious.  He was funny on occasion, though.  He is just too smart to teach undergraduate courses, especially a lower division GE course.   The lectures, were however, very easy to follow with nice visuals and good organization.  Lecture notes were available on online, and if you read and went to section, there was little point in going to class."
Scott M Pletka,NA,Archaeology of North America,ANTHRO 113P,N/A,"I thought the class was pretty interesting.  We only had to write four short essays, which were graded fairly.  Yeah, so Scott is very uptight and anal, but it's part of his character.  He's obviously very knowledgeable about archaeology, and I'd take more of his classes in the future."
Alice Mandell,NA,Jerusalem: Holy City,AN N EA 10W,N/A,"She is the WORST prof I've ever had in my 4 years at UCLA. She doesn't care about students at all. She only offers OH one day of every week and she is not negotiable in terms of extra OH. She said she is only available at one time. Her lectures are boring and not intriguing at all.  She never posts slides which forces you to attend boring lectures. Really, if you want to have a happy and useful writing II experience, never take her class. She really ruined my last quarter."
Alice Mandell,NA,Jerusalem: Holy City,AN N EA 10W,N/A,"About the class:The class is definitely not as easy as everyone says it is! The GE component (midterm and final exams) is easy but the papers are not easy to write! The prompts are dense and they definitely take a lot of thought and research to do well in. There is a lot of information to cover and they want you to make a lot of connections in the paper. But everything is completely doable! As long as you put in time and effort and ask your TA for feedback, it is all good! The class itself is pretty interesting to me because its not really about religion but about HOW that religion sees Jerusalem as a special place. We are standing in a neutral scholar point of view to examine the religion and their religious views. I kinda struggled with this idea in the beginning but it was fine after the first 2-3 weeks!About the professor:She is clear and very lenient! She gives out study guides but she doesnt post her slides! Some times she would say something but the slide would give other information so it was kinda hectic trying to jot down information from both the slide and from what she was saying."
Worku Nida,NA,Afro-American Experience in U.S.,ANTHRO M144Q,N/A,"LISTEN! DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! He picks favorites,  his entire class was based on equality and exclaimed that no one should experience any form of discrimination. However, his actions failed to emulate anything he taught! He doesn't want to help students and he puts down the opinions of others if they don't match his opinions. I REGRET TAKING HIS CLASS!!!!!!!!! HE IS AWFUL!!!!"

Worku Nida,NA,Afro-American Experience in U.S.,ANTHRO M144Q,N/A,"Professor Nida was excellent. His M164 class was probably one of my favorites that I've taken at UCLA. He began the class explaining that students needed to be comfortable to talk and express their thoughts in class. I usually don't feel comfortable speaking in class, especially if I don't agree with the professor, but Nida created a very comfortable environment where students could speak their mind. The class was easy, especially if you did the readings. I didn't do several readings and still got an  A in the class. The best thing was that Nida was always willing to speak with you during office hours to expand further on topics. Talking to him during office hours is where I realized that he really wanted students to open themselves up to ideas that might seem uncomfortable. Maybe to you it feels wrong that an author would write about African Americans during the Jim Crow era enjoying themselves. But Nida had us read these authors to open us to the idea that African Americans are not simply victims. They were instrumental to the creation of the U.S. Sure Nida's accent is a little hard to understand once in a while, but he was an excellent teacher who really cares. Take him. "
Worku Nida,NA,Afro-American Experience in U.S.,ANTHRO M144Q,N/A,Worku is an idiot. He is completely incompetent and extremely difficult to understand. He thinks that whatever he says is pure fact. He does not meet in office hours and does not respond to e-mail.  If you take his class I highly recommend that you purely agree with everything he says to get a good grade.
Worku Nida,NA,Afro-American Experience in U.S.,ANTHRO M144Q,N/A," At times, Professor Nida can be difficult to understand and to get along with, but his intelligence and dedication put him in the top nth percent of professors at UCLA for overall class value. At first, much of the assignments he assigns, mainly the 1-3 weekly reading responses, seem like mindless busy work or Dr. Nida's attempt at weeding out the less dedicated students. Don't get me wrong, these assignments do serve this purpose, but they also serve a student extremely well on the midterm, term paper, and final. If you stay faithful to these weekly tasks, ask relevant questions in class to clear up any misunderstandings, finding out what he wants in the process; you are sure to learn valuable material concerning African American history, which is largely unrepresented in the historical ""canon."" In addition, this will also put you on the path to an attractive grade in the end. By all means, GO TO OFFICE HOURS, very cliche, but especially relevant in this class. Like Grandma wolf or something, the better he knows your face and your work ethic, the better to judge your participation grade with. Many students dislike this class because they are used to going into Afro-Am classes repeating material that they looked up on Wikipedia right before class, saying some politically correct and attractive statement, or schmoozing with the instructor. This will not work with Nida because he seems to see right through those feeble attempts. I've taken the time to write this long review because I believe that it may help some other student, because the class changed my life, and I obtained a great grade, even though my views in class rarely ever aligned with the professor's, something that most students are hard pressed to find here at UCLA. Take this class if only to broaden your perspective and open yourself up to a necessary challenge.  "
Worku Nida,NA,Afro-American Experience in U.S.,ANTHRO M144Q,N/A,"If you come to class on time, participate in class discussions, and do the assigned work you are garanteed an A. Having a clear thesis and supported argument on your papers is key. This may sound like a lot, so I suggest only taking this class if you are interested in the subject matter. "
Worku Nida,NA,Sub-Saharan Africa,ANTHRO 166P,N/A,"One word: AWFUL.  Seriously, stay away.  Far far away.    "
Worku Nida,NA,Sub-Saharan Africa,ANTHRO 166P,N/A,"I just want to clarify that pertaining to the review below- I do not know whether Nida grades according to how much he likes you, nor do I believe that he is unethical. I was being sarcastic. I also do not know for a fact that someone was not deducted points when other people were. I did not see the paper in question. "
Worku Nida,NA,Sub-Saharan Africa,ANTHRO 166P,N/A,"Run; do not walk, away from this class. Unless you are a masochist, then by all means, sign up! This class was a punishment. You are NOT guaranteed an A by doing all the work. You may be guaranteed an A if he likes you, which is, of course unethical. For example, most students got marked off for citation errors on their midterm paper, but certain people who made the same errors did not.  He is not willing to give back a fraction of the amount of work and dedication that he expects you to put in. If you post your weekly responses a minute late, he will not accept them. Yet he posted the final study guide 2DAYS LATE. And the final had little to do with the study guide, and was framed in a very ""gotcha"" fashion. Even students previously enamored of this class were upset after the final(only 2 people got the high score of 33 out of 40 on the final). I read every page of every reading, posted my weekly questions on time, participated in class, studied for days for the final, and still got a B in this class. I am an A/A+ student, I have (HAD!) a 4.0 GPA, and I got the first B ever in this class. He is the worst professor and a discredit to UCLA."
Worku Nida,NA,Sub-Saharan Africa,ANTHRO 166P,N/A,"Oh how I regret taking this class. The subject is interesting but the professor makes it totally uninteresting. He requires a ton of reading and weekly commentaries, but when it comes to class he goes off of tangents and never addresses the readings. Don't ask him anything because he will always tell you to look at the syllabus. If you are really interested in the material take this class but be prepared for lots of reading with no professor input and participate or your grade will suffer."
Louise E Tallen,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 9,N/A,"Prof. Tallen definitely knows what she is talking about, although she talks a whole lot, all the while scribbling on an overhead projector. I felt like I was back in high school, except I didn't have the chance to interrupt class every time I missed something. I found her style to be somewhat condescending and cold, almost frigid. I don't think I saw her crack a smile during the whole ten weeks. Also, out of the four required ethnographies, one was outdated and another was so one sided, unscientific, and badly written that I'm surprised it was published, let alone picked as required reading for a class. My T.A. even pointed this out, and we had a homework assignment where we had to explain why the book was so bad. I, much like some of my fellow reviewers, also got screwed over by her grading system, but it's not like I studied all that hard for the midterm anyway. All in all, I would have had a rather mediocre time in Anthro 9 had it not been for this gorgeous little vixen that sat just at the edge of my field of vision at almost every lecture. Anthropology is the of humans, right?"
Louise E Tallen,NA,Introduction to Psychological Anthropology: Historical Development,ANTHRO 136A,N/A,"Although Dr. Tallens lectures are dry most of the time, the material is very interesting. The lectures are very well organized. There was one paper. It was easy since she wanted us to write about ourselves. She is all bark and no bite. She tells you exactly what is going to be on the midterm and final. She gives a few possible questions and you have to answer two of them. She also has short answer Id's which she gives a list of before hand. Nobody should have a problem getting an A on her exams and in the class. I have also heard she is an expert at catching exam cheaters, so don't even attempt it. If you need to cheat in her class you should noty be at UCLA. Give up your spot to someone who wants to be here."
Louise E Tallen,NA,Introduction to Psychological Anthropology: Historical Development,ANTHRO 136A,N/A,"Her lectures are organized and very routine. The work load is reasonable. The only problem i have with her is her unfair grading system. she DOES NOT give out pluses and minuses so pretty much a 80% - 89% is a B. It think this is very unreasonable and does not give us what grade we deserve. I went to debate my grade because i knew i did better than a B and found out that i got a 89% but she told me, ""I don't give out pluses and minuses."" WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?????"
Louise E Tallen,NA,Anthropology of Religion,ANTHRO 142P,N/A,The first half of the course was much more interesting than the second half.  The midterm and finally were very predicatable and easy to study for.  Just take good notes in class and study beforehand.  She gave us a review sheet before hand and that helped a lot.  She is a good lecturer and is easy to understand.
Linda C Garro,NA,Fiat Lux Freshman Seminars,ANTHRO 19,F,This was a great class. Professor Garro is an incredibly knowledgeable professor having done work in Canada. She is oftentimes funny. Every week consisted of reading articles on Paul Farmer's journey/ Partners in Health and intersection of anthropology and biomedicine. Discussion is very interesting. I learned in this class that healthcare is a right
Linda C Garro,NA,Field Methods in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 138P,N/A,"I just read all the postings about Professor Garro. She must really have improved her style over the last few years. I took her final today (so I dont know my grade yet) and I believe that she is an excellent professor. Sometimes her lectures jump around and it can get pretty confusing. Luckily, she gave out a ton of handouts with everything you need to know. The downside to that was having to review them all for tests and she would give information you didnt need. If you're one of those people who likes to learn just to learn, then these handouts are great and so beneficial. If you just want to get a grade and move on, the handouts will drive you crazy. The assignments were vital to learning methodology. There were absolutely no surprises on either the midterm or final -- they were very fair. She would literally say ""know this for the test."" The questions were well thought out and very understandable (as they should be since she does write interviews and ethnographies for a living). She repeats important concepts a lot which is great because you know exactly what she wants you to know and it makes studying easier. Her TA was one of the best I've had in this department. She made discussion fun, was very knowledgable and obviously had great communication with the professor. Garros fieldwork is interesting and she chooses readings that are very relevant and helpful. If you are interested in doing fieldwork one day, think you could ever be interested in it, or are trying to decide if anthropology is right for you, I highly recommend taking her class. If I had taken this class during my first year at UCLA rather than my last year, I probably would have understood other anthropology courses better and probably would have attempted to do fieldwork each summer. I'm expecting a B in the class, only because I didn't try as hard as I should have. But she makes getting an A in her class very possible."
Linda C Garro,NA,Field Methods in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 138P,N/A,"In almost four years at UCLA I have never had such a bad class as this one. Her lectures are extremely dry and boring. It felt like each lecture was five hours long. If you are a student who likes to go to office hours, you can count on being rushed out of her office as soon as possible. She is more interested in her own outside research than the class she teaches. The assignments she assigns are a complete waste of time, and so are the discussions with the T.A. Nothing was learned in the discussions. All of this is coming from an A student. If you do take her class you better agree with her opinions and write them on your midterm, or else..."
Linda C Garro,NA,Field Methods in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 138P,N/A,"Garro is a good teacher who gives a fair amount of reading, relevant assignments, and fair exams.  If you go to class, do the readings, and do some studying before the exams you'll do just fine.  Anthro 139 is definately more interesting if you're an anthro major.  If you're planning on doing research or plan on grad school, I think this class is worth taking."
Linda C Garro,NA,"Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology: Doctors, Clinics, and Biomedicine",ANTHRO 139,B,The lectures feel pointless. It’s just slides with random quotes that aren’t even part in the assigned readings. She spent the first few weeks complaining about being online. Repetitive and unorganized. Not even the TA knew what was going on. I’m not sure what I was supposed to take from this class…Don’t recommend
Linda C Garro,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,B-," Professor Garro is a very knowledgable scholar, but an absolutely terrible lecturer. Her lectures are mostly explanations of readings for that week, but her explanations were hard to follow due to her constant stuttering, lack of proper wording, and confusing use of quotes from readings. This accompanied with uninformative slides which often do not pertain to what she is saying, made listening to her feel more like a headache than a relief from understanding the class material. The lack of coherent structure in her lectures made it confusing to take lecture notes due to the frequent rubber banding between going back and going forward on content and concepts. As for the material itself, there's 1 to 3 readings of 6 to 30 pages required per week from her own work published in the early 2000s or from older medical anthropologists' publications from the 1970s to 1990s. The contents of the material were not too hard to follow, but most of them included complex themes and concepts were often confusing and needed further explanation are severely lacking, as previously stated. Lastly her attitude towards the class was supposedly very supportive and positive, according to the TA, but Garro's interaction with the class has mostly been absent or otherwise negative. In the earlier weeks of the class she used to ask questions but as the students answered her question, she would reply with an uninterested ""Ok"" until one student barely scratches the ""right"" answer which no one but her seemed to have been able to guess correctly. Other times, she would outright tell the student they are wrong or give a sarcastic answer of 'Is it?' while trying to speak over them without letting them finish their thought/answer. Unsurprisingly the students stopped participating in fear they would just be dismissed for attempting. Overall, I would not recommend Garro. Her class has been the most unenjoyable experience I've had in my 4 years in UCLA. The content I've consumed from this class seemed to just turn me further towards disgust and annoyance about a topic that initially interested me due to its premise of understanding cultures' approach to medicine. Garro's teaching seemed to have entirely dismissed the objective truths we know about biomedicine while exoticising the non-Western approaches to medicine."
Linda C Garro,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,F,"Professor Garro's class was by far the worst class I have taken in my academic career. First of all, I was extremely excited to take med anthro as I have been interested in this subject matter for a long time- Dr. Garro changed my approach to this field and I will not be coming back. Her workload is unbelievably heavy, unreasonably heavy. There are weeks where she assigns over 200 pages of material, on which there will be detailed questions (so, no, do not read the intro and the conclusion- a solution that her TA suggested). She is inaccessible outside of the classroom and it is apparent teaching is an inconvenience to her and a nuisance that is a side effect of her research work. She is a dry, boring, and confusing (impossible to follow) lecturer. Her TA suggested we were just not intelligent enough to understand her extremely complicated chain of thought, but I believe that truly intelligent people find a way to convey their knowledge, so we will have to disagree there. All in all, her exams are unfair, as she is so behind on the lecture material questions are asked on material that has never been discussed and her understanding of it is often much different than what would be expected. She offers no explanations, holds grades hostage (even after the work has been graded), for instance, we received final grades before any other grades were made available. I am convinced her only goal in life is to make students' lives a living hell."
Linda C Garro,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,A-," Horribly disorganized. The subject was very interesting and some of the assigned readings were pretty insightful, but progression through material was markedly inconsistent- many things that were very important on the final and midterms were rushed through, while things that weren't as focused on took up most of the time. (See NO STUDY GUIDE...save for the hard fought for midterm study guide) The grading rubrics for the assigned papers were also very unclear and seemed like they were worded to be more confusing than helpful- including information and questions that were not relevant to the points needing to be addressed. Finally, the professor was very committed to her opinions on the material where it wasn't obvious what the ""correct"" answer was. Disagree AT YOUR OWN PERIL. I may have gotten an A in the class and I trust that both the TA and Professor are good people, but I cannot in good conscience recommend this class to anyone."
Linda C Garro,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,F,I hate this class so much. It's so much work and if you're not interested in random native American/ Mexican medical practices like me don't take this class. She is so boring and her grading and prompts are so weird and unclear. Tests are really hard and she is very against study guides.  Overall a boring waste of time and money; would not recommend
Linda C Garro,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,A-,"Do yourself a favor, don't take her. Her lectures are extremely unclear (they're powerpoints with paragraphs that have been copy pasted from the readings). She is not nice or understanding; she made a student cry in my class for asking a question. She said ""thats a dumb question why would you even ask that??"". Her TA, Stephanie, was honestly the only positive part of this entire experience. Hands down, Garro was the worst professor I have ever had."
Linda C Garro,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,A,"The worst part about this class was the lack of clarity. I never really had a gauge of how much I needed to put into what aspects of the class, and many of the readings were dense and confusing. The tests were only hard because a lot of questions would be very specific, like ""which author said this"" or ""what piece of work is this from"". Her slides were pretty useful for the tests, but they were also literally just blocks of quotes. I stopped attending a lot of lectures towards the end and just reviewing the slides and I still ended up doing ok. The class structure was three 2-page reflection papers on a question from the readings, one midterm, one 6-8 page final paper, and one final. I just found it annoying that we had both a final paper and a final test, but both were graded very leniently so I guess that makes up for it."
Linda C Garro,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology: Medical Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,B+,"Her lectures are literally quotes. Emilia, the TA is literally the only reason why we understood anything. Some of the stuff was interesting but the readings were so long it took away from it. Tests are difficult and not everything will be covered by the TA because of how much information there is. She’s obviously very knowledgeable in the field but doesn’t realize reading quotes off slides from weekly readings aren’t doing much."
Linda C Garro,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology: Medical Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,F," The entire class was basically taught by the T.A., Emilia. Emilia is FANTASTIC and really honed in on every detail that we had to know. I took extensive notes during discussion sections with Emilia, which I credit any good grades I got to. Emilia broke down concepts and taught them to us in a way that I could really understand.  Prof. Garro has a terrible lecture style. All she does is read quotes off the screen. She is hard to understand and hard to follow. The lectures were on zoom and I didn't learn a single thing from any of her lectures. Prof. Garro's class is basically based off of her own research and own writings. There is a lot of reading for this class and it would be helpful if you took good notes on all of the readings. As someone who likes medicine, I enjoyed the readings, but I definitely did not read all of them. The midterm was not too bad. I got around a B. The questions were pretty fair. Mostly free response, a few multiple choice.  I don't recommend this class unless you want to teach yourself. Prof. Garro is undeniably intelligent but she is not a great teacher. If the T.A. wasn't so amazing I would have failed."
Marjorie H Goodwin,NA,Language in Culture,ANTHRO M150,N/A," Professor Goodwin is really passionate about her material and cares a lot about student input - she would literally run down the aisle if someone wanted to make a comment. She shows a lot of video clips and has guest speakers. That being said, it is somewhat difficult to follow along to her lectures. She is never quite clear on what information you need to remember. She jumps from topic to topic really quickly. However, the midterm and final ended up being very easy because of the straightforward study guides she gave us (which had the exact topics you needed to know).  Keep in mind that a good percentage of your grade will be determined by the TAs, for participation and a group project. Overall I ended up enjoying this class."
Marjorie H Goodwin,NA,Language in Culture,ANTHRO M150,N/A," It should be a crime to insults someone's opinions without letting yourself be criticized for your very own.  Goodwin preaches more than she teaches the material. She uses all her own sources, her text, her articles to the mere point of promoting her and her beliefs instead of linguistic anthropology.It adds mockery to the field as she stating you can say anything you want about body language and get published. My perspective is more right than yours is her motto. In addition to this, she had her TA's run the course in the same manner. They're right, you're wrong, and there's no way you could be right. Misa Dayson was absent minded in her discussions and biased in her grading.  This first year grad student would assume Professor status as she became the expert in linguistic anthropology, somehow overnight, you can look at any body language behaviour, make a comment, and since I'm the TA I'm right. Dayson would waste time during discussion sections making us turn in questions on articles instead of helping us prepare to learn the material.  When grading the exams, she would grade more on the terms of who she liked during discussion then whether their answers were right. The same for the projects and the same for the take-home final exam. How can people do poorly on a take-home final exam? And how can people do poorly on a project where you make your observations? O yea, it's only when you have a TA interested so much in her ego and status that her opinions are right irrespective of others. Goodwin failed to address this unfair practice, and hid in her office while the linguistics department was getting cut that year and she continued to preach her material, as long as she had her high paying professor gig who cared, i have tenure i can do anything attitude The only reason people took her course was because she handled the grading and they tolerated with her preaching of her beliefs to get a good grade. But when she gave authority to the TAs, it was free for all grading, judge the material as if you were certified experts in the field.  There should be an audit in this class about how she handled grading. The previous years 80% or more students got A's, Now students got 30% B's 20% C's, what did students get dumber after a quarter, did college material degraded so much that students output were that poor, No it was TA with high standards, Misa Dayson, who doesn't even live up to high standards, from what I hear from students in other courses and other GRAD students for that matter too, Ahh the quality of students that the Anthropology department admits and the failure to check up or address this, further degrading our discipline, and a professor who hid and can't explain this, well as long as she gets what she wants while the department suffers, she wins"
Marjorie H Goodwin,NA,Language in Culture,ANTHRO M150,N/A," What an absolutely horrid experience. Professor Goodwin used some incompetent TAs with attitude problems for Anthro M140. For review session, the TAs said we are here to answer questions, then they would answer our questions with questions and you should know instead of helping. It was clear that one TA was the head TA that led the other one around as she didn't know what she was doing. For section, my TA, dawson or dickson, would waste time to purposely make sure we weren't ready for exams or papers as she wasn't prepared for section. At least state that you don't know the answer instead of giving us made up answers that you believe is right that will get us marked off points on exams that you graded. As for the professor, I've heard raving reviews from past students, but after this course... I think they were more mesmerized by her easy grading. Don't let me go on about her making us buy her pricy textbook and read her articles. Not so much with this course as she let the TAs do all the harsh grading. Some students I talked with who took her previous courses would say they submitted even better work than her past classes but received worst marks. It is obvious that she lacks a spine and care because she didn't even go over any of the papers and exams and grades when the final grades were released. You'll feel taken back when you see what you get for the loads of reading that you do and time spent studying. If you're looking to take this class with her, expect low marks and harsh criticism from TAs who can't even explain themselves. With teaching like this, it's no wonder that the linguistics department has been cut. And for the better too if students receive this crap.  "
Marjorie H Goodwin,NA,Language in Culture,ANTHRO M150,N/A," Geezus! This class felt like a marathon race the whole way through. Over 1000 pages of reading that you actually had to do to get the point and to do the discussion homework. Now I am not one of those students that is always looking for an easy-A, however, if I worked hard I would have like to have come away with a much greater knowlege... but I feel that was not accomplished. On a quartersystem cramming in 6-10 readings a week was just not feasibe. I barely understood all the material... like main idea okay, but in depth knowledge... NO.  TA suck! They are not organized and bring nothing to help us understand the piles of readings and pages of lecture notes. They sit there and ask us to ask questions... uhh. most weeks I would not even understand the questions people asked or they would go off on tangent! UGH!!!!! One section  I sat there thinking, ""I have nothing to say because I don't give a crap about this!""  I was really frustrated with all the readings because I could not enjoy any of it. At the beginning I thought this course was going to be great... but it was just WAYYY to much- crammed in.  Testing was probably the one good thing: Midterm- given 6 questions up front; they are hard, but they pick 3 for the midterm so you have plenty of time to collaborate about them. Final is a take home 24 hours to complete it after filling out a study guide of terms. This was okay... but one question was on a realy hard reading that we had just read and had no time to process... WTF.. so not sure how people did on that one.  One group paper.. ours was 25 pages... my experience was not to bad...my group members were awesome, but I could see this being a nightmare! I do not know my grade... but I tried very hard to attend every lecture/ discussion/ do the readings.  Bottom Line: This Class is a NO. I am Anthro BS and balancing this with two jobs and LS 3... not a good mix. subject can be interesting at time... but class needs to be worked on and condensed and refined!!!!!  UGH I am so glade that class is OVER!!!!! "
Marjorie H Goodwin,NA,Language in Culture,ANTHRO M150,N/A,"Nitpicky TAs. I don't want to suggest favoritism, but you can get that feeling in this class. Also, the grade distribution for this class is really low, like 5% As, 5% A-s, 40% Bs, 40% Cs, and 10% C-s, Ds, and Fs. I personally prefer Kroskrity, because he gives multiple choice exams, papers, and goes over the readings thoroughly, and there are no discussion sections, so none of that unfair $@$!%!#."
Marjorie H Goodwin,NA,Language in Culture,ANTHRO M150,N/A,"This class is difficult, because she piles readings upon readings without clear explanations in class. In TA discussion sections, people who talk the most get favored in grading even if their answers were obviously wrong. The TAs have the most power in this class and don't even run discussion, they just let the most vocal voice their opinions. I don't have a problem with that, but when students speaks in rude manner and talk about irrelevant topics, it is disheartening to see your grade is lower than theirs when you did the reading and studied. I know because I was in the same group as them"
Marjorie H Goodwin,NA,Language in Culture,ANTHRO M150,N/A,"Her classes are fun. Especially because of the discussions, because if you just talk the longest, you'll get the full participation credit. If you actually do the readings and try to understand, its not that important. If you participate and just say things, even though it might not be completely related to the readings, as long as its an interesting point, then you get credit. Trust me it helps. It definitely helped when I was a borderline grade from an A, so don't worry about doing any readings (I didn't) and it went completely well for me. Just participate the most because thats what happens mostly during class and discussion, and besides the TAs don't know how to run a real section and lecture anyways."
Marjorie H Goodwin,NA,Language in Culture,ANTHRO M150,N/A," For the class Anthro M140, she just piles the class with reading after reading after reading after reading. It wouldn't be so bad if the TAs were there to help elaborate on the reading, but instead they want the students to interpret the works, and when that happens, you get students that don't understand the work get full participation, and everyone doing really bad on the exams, but the student that wins in the end is the student that says raises his hand. also, the class places a lot of power into the TAs, and this is not a bad thing, but it is bad when they are harsh graders working against the student at all times. I find that if the professor pick a better set of TAs this class would be good, or she was able to go over the readings a little in class or have TAs do so it would be helpful. I'm not looking to take any more of these classes."
Marjorie H Goodwin,NA,Language in Culture,ANTHRO M150,N/A,"Correction on the previous review, I meant Ling M146 not Ling M140. Ling M146 counts for the same credit as Anth M140. I really liked this professor, and she is really helpful. Come to the first day of classes to see if you can get in the class if you need it. Definitely take if this is a requirement. I just wish the TAs have the same enthusiasm and understanding she does and were more helpful instead of being really nitpicky and pushy and grade tyrants. "
Marjorie H Goodwin,NA,Language in Culture,ANTHRO M150,N/A,"I took Anthro M140, which you can also register as Ling M140, with Goodwin and she is one of the best professors I have had here at UCLA. I really valued my time in the class and wish she taught more."
Marjorie H Goodwin,NA,Language in Culture,ANTHRO M150,N/A,"I got an A in this course by sitting in front,  it's not necessary, but easier for participation. Once she knows who you are, I feel the class is much easier, as she interacts with you more. Honestly, most of the lecture material is background/research info, as the readings become the material to use for Midterm, Project, and Final. I didn't read Bonvillain, I skimmed Professor Goodwin's book, read many of the articles, missed a few lectures, and felt completely prepared for the exams. She is intent on getting a discussion going during lectures, and her enthusiasm is wonderful, albeit sometimes kooky. She is approachable and friendly, and I enjoyed visiting her for a review session, as she made me feel like I had mastered her class. Although her material was not what I had been interested in before, I now LOVE the subject...not everyone will, but it isn't hard to do well. So, just participate a bit and follow the explicitly clear questions for the essay-based exams, and there's no reason you won't get an A! This class taught me a lot about personal interaction, and it became an interesting subject to get into. No doubt she's one of the best, if not the best, professors I've had in my college career! Take Goodwin just because she's smart and sweet and you'll probably learn a lot without a lot of stress! "
Marjorie H Goodwin,NA,Language in Culture,ANTHRO M150,N/A,"Professor Goodwin is so sweet.  Lectures were pretty much just reading transcriptions and watching video clips...over and over again.  I personally could not concentrate because I wasn't use to her style of teaching...also because most of my attention was drawn at the white clumps of saliva that would collect at the edges of her mouth...it just made me want to wipe my own lips.  Anyways there is a lot LOT of reading...I was surprisingly able to keep up with all the reading up until the midterm...and did pretty well on it.  The average for the midterm was a low B and I got a 92%...but then I also had the best study group of my life (my grade on the midterm being the second lowest of the 5 of us).  The article readings are way more important than either of the books used in class...so really study the articles.  There is also a section for this class in which you have to submit a ""precis"" assignment before every section.  The TA just checks you off to see if you did the assignment, so you get full credit...you can easily BS the precis each week and get by.  There is also a group project thats worth 30% of your grade.  So long as you pick a good topic, good group members and are/act interested in the topic you picked...you should do well because the average for the group projects was a low A.  Also, she gives you the questions for her exams the lecture before...so...I did NONE of the readings after the midterm...but I went to EVERY lecture and had a great study group for the final...and was able to pull off an A.  Lastly, she is very personable (although she often, but unknowingly, uses an intense stare that pierces through her glasses and paralyzes you with awkwardness if you're sitting in the front rows), concerned with student learning and actually enjoys writing letters of recommendations.  I regret not knowing her better, because she would have given me a letter of rec if I asked for one.  So I would definitely recommend Professor Goodwin!!"
Marjorie H Goodwin,NA,Language in Culture,ANTHRO M150,N/A,"A very nice professor, interesting lectures, lots of reading though, but the material is quite interesting. I pulled an A-, I read for the first 3 weeks, then just skimmed and cramed at the end. She gives out study guides, all that would be on the exam, just answer those questions and you are home free!"
Marjorie H Goodwin,NA,Language in Culture,ANTHRO M150,N/A,"Don't let her seemingly unorganized teaching style deter you from taking the class--she does a great job exposing students to what the field of Linguistic Anthropology has to offer...I left the class more interested in the field of Linguistic Anthropology than before I took it.The material is quite interesting. As long as you do the readings (especially the articles) and fill out the studyguides she gives, you'll ace the final. She really sets everything up so that you can slam-dunk the tests. Very concerned about student learning, good about making herself available in office hours. And a very sweet person :)"
Marjorie H Goodwin,NA,Language in Culture,ANTHRO M150,N/A,"I have so many good things to say about professor Goodwin and this class that I dont know where to begin... This is so far one of many favorite classes, partly because of Goodwin's enthusiasm but also because I realized how important language is in society. This class requires work and effort, Goodwin expects hands on experience in a field project and the reading load is heavy but all the work pays off as it leads to profound understanding about language and society. Goodwin inspired and motivated us all to perform our best, an admirable characteristic in a professor. She is approachable, concerned, and fully deovited to her field and her students. Three words: Take this class!"
Marjorie H Goodwin,NA,Language in Culture,ANTHRO M150,N/A,"Entering this class, I had low expectations for it (I'm not a linguist by trade).  By the end of the quarter, the care and concern Professor Goodwin and her T.A. had exhibited made this course into one of my favorites to date.  This is a methods course, so you will be expected to complete some heavy-duty fieldwork.  Don't be intimidated ... if you want to be a field linguist or a linguistic anthropologist, this *is* the class for you to try your hand at it.  The readings were all excellent, and there was ample material provided in class to do well on both the project and any tests.  In addition, Professor Goodwin demonstrated an enormous amount of concern with student welfare.  She is very approachable and encourages discussions within the lecture.  I would highly recommend her for all anthropology students."
Marjorie H Goodwin,NA,Ethnography of Everyday Speech,ANTHRO 151,N/A,"Professor Goodwin is by far my favorite professor at UCLA, and her class is an eye-opening experience. The class itself is a quarter long project that allows you to apply the concepts learned in class to a field site analyzing how language is used in everyday interaction. This class makes you apply the knowledge to the real world rather than just memorizing facts for an exam, which is how college should be. Goodwin is there every step of the way to help you and encourage you to do your best. Her lectures were very interesting, and her fieldwork is fascinating and expansive. She is so sweet and a caring professor, I highly recommend any anthropology major to take a class with her at least once, she is the best thing to happen to your college experience."
Dwight Read,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"It's simply impossible to take notes from Prof. Read. He's definitely a nice guy and always willing to help. What I liked about him is that he's real professional about his job and gets the job done. Homework was way too much and VERY VERY tedious, having no point to it because none of the material was on the exams.  His exams are pure lecture based so the book is totally useless.  Again, he speaks way too fast not to mention makes the material very boring to follow, which makes note taking impossible."
Dwight Read,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Professor Read is such a nice guy! His lectures can get a bit boring, but the subject matter is really boring. His tests are MORE than fair. You don't even have to read the book. As long as you go to lecture, you'll do fine in the class. I got the highest grade, so I'm not lying. The homework is a bit tedious and long and I didn't really see a point in it, but it's easy points and not difficult. I would definitely recommed him if you want to get a good grade. He's one of the easiet Anthro 7 professors there are."
Dwight Read,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"I thought that Professor Read did a decent job making (in my opinion) such a boring subject semi-interesting.  His lectures were boring, but I honestly did learn a lot.  His tests were multiple choice, which is TOTALLY EASY compared to the other Anthro. 7 classes (which were short answer/essay).  Go to office hours if you have ANY questions, he is such a sweet, kind man, and is highly respected in his field.  Gets the job done."
Dwight Read,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"Wow . . . this guy needs to retire already!  He's one of the dullest professors I have ever had.  He was at least a week behind, then a week or two before the final, he suddenly became determined to catch up . . . I slept through his class all the time, yet somehow I managed to pull an A.  Memorize the handouts and you'll be fine (just bored).  The book was a lot more interesting than he was!"
Dwight Read,NA,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,STATS 10,N/A,"Professor Read is one of the worst professors I've taken this year. Not only is he absolutely boring but he makes everything seem harder and more tedious than it really is. I didn't know one person in the class who understood what he was doing. His notes don't correspond with the homework and neither the notes nor the homework correspond with the tests. If possible, stay away from this guy's class."
Dwight Read,NA,Culture: What Makes It All Work,ANTHRO 131,N/A,"This class would have been so much fun if it had been taught by someone else!  He is the worst professor I have had in the department by far.  The lectures are so boring and long, and I feel like I learn just as much of the material by reading the lecture slides on my own as by listening to him talk, if not more.  The midterm is half multiple choice and half short answer -- I got 100% on the short answer and 66% on the multiple choice -- so I obviously knew my stuff but he just makes his multiple choice questions so tricky!  If you do decide to take his class, don't bother showing up to lecture.  You'll be fine as long as you keep up with the readings and review the slides and notes that he posts."
Dwight Read,NA,Culture: What Makes It All Work,ANTHRO 131,N/A," Ok, Professor Read actually listens to you while you talk.  He is really nice.  You almost wouldn't guess he is the chair for the Human Complex Systems Minor Program and that he's a well accomplished Mathamatician, Anthrolopogist, and is really the type of professor that is discovering new research. TEACHINGHe's just too smart that his lectures are a bit confusing and it is hard to take notes.  He uses a lot of pictures and graphs and his powerpoints are good - yet the concepts are a bit complicated and he sort of complicates it more with presenting it in a very mathematical, statistical format.  He's well spoken but after a while those big words just start mumbling in your head and you can't figure out what the message is. READER/GRADERThe grader sucks, he doesn't hold office hours or provides feedback on your work. FINAL EXAMThe final is weird, it's a bit tricky and you can mess up on it very easily.  Even ifyou studied you never really feel like you have grasped the concepts. Take him if you want, he's someone very approachable and maybe if you visit him often he can help you with the concepts, but he's very distinguished and busy.  TAKE THE HONORS CLASS VERY EASY!"
Dwight Read,NA,"Marriage, Family, and Kinship",ANTHRO M145P,N/A,"Professor Read is certainly very intelligent, but intelligence doesn't always translate to a good professor. He's also nice and friendly, which is why I hate to say that his lectures are incredibly dry and boring and difficult to sit through. If you have to take one of his classes, make sure you do the readings! That is the ONLY way you will get through the class. I learned this the hard way when I realized I was completely lost regarding the paper topic the night before it was due. His prompt was so poorly written that I misunderstood the purpose of the paper, and clearly the rest of the class felt the same way because he had to send out several emails explaining what he meant. I essentially had to REWRITE my essay when his prompt finally became clear, and I usually have no problem whatsoever with essays. However, I can say that he does make himself available for questions and seems to care about his students. He also grades on a curve which is a HUGE help considering most people fail his exams. "
Dwight Read,NA,"Marriage, Family, and Kinship",ANTHRO M145P,N/A," Usually I read the reviews on here and think that students are really unfair to the teachers...HOWEVER, these reviews are RIGHT ON. I took him and I can honestly say that I barley learned anything. He has a PhD in math, but likes to teach anthro, thus he teaches his anthro class like a math class would be taught. the GOOD news is that i got a B in the class. He curved all the tests, which everyone failed basically, hes also nice and throws out the random top scoring outliers when he makes the curve. half of our final was a take home opinion based paper, so that was nice too. Read is a really nice guy, but he is just too intelligent sounding to have anyone follow him. If you take him, its possible to get a good grade and not know that much. I would never attend lectures, just memorize his lecture notes online, they are much clearer then when he actually lectures in person.  take at your own risk. you can survive his class by not knowing that much, but thats only if the rest of the class is on the same page as you, which luckily, mine was :)"
Dwight Read,NA,"Marriage, Family, and Kinship",ANTHRO M145P,N/A,"Prof. Reed is a nice, warm, approachable man.  His lectures are thorough and he often uses PowerPoint and/or overheads to supplement oral information.  He is obviously extremely knowledgeable about his field.  The only problems I had with this class is that (1) he taught it from a mathematical perspective (he is triple degreed in math), which (2) made the lectures dull and boring to me as I ""don't do number.""  I am a horrible math student, which is why I am a Anthro major and not a Math or Sciences major!  I took the Anthro M151 class with him in Fall 2004 and still cannot explain to my friends how kinship can be taught from a mathematical perspective!  I expected the class to be taught from a social or cultural perspective, which makes more sense to me.  If you take him for this class, I recommend that you consider yourself a good math student -- it will make your comprehension of the way he teaches this class clearer.  He is a kind, caring Professor, but no amount of time reading, visiting his office hours, etc. was going to make this (mathematical) subject matter sink into my brain."
Dwight Read,NA,"Marriage, Family, and Kinship",ANTHRO M145P,N/A,"I took his kinship class and while i was very interested in the material before, after i was left confused and half learned.  Read is a very nice, caring man but his lectures are confusing and his lecture style is very sloppy.  At times he,himself puts up diagrams that once in front of the class has forgotten what the point or connection was.  if you have already taken anthro 9 the begining of the class will seem very similar until you get to the complexity that is kinship and at this point the whol class was confused up until the final. while he tries to explain the fact that he is unoragnized at times does not help.  there is a midterm and final as well as a family tree project and a second kinship projet.  Overall if you can take it with a better teacher do so but Read is a good guy, hes approachable and the class is very do-able."
Dwight Read,NA,"Marriage, Family, and Kinship",ANTHRO M145P,N/A,"Prof. Read was awesome! I definately reccomend anyone interested in kinship systems to take this class.  Anyone not interested in the course material might find the complex kin diagrams a bit daunting, but Prof Read goes out of his way to do everything possible for all of his student to do well in his class and understand all the material.  He postponed the midterm to give us an extra study day, and he delayed the paper to ease students' stress during finals week.  All over a brilliant man who tries very hard to do everything possible to help his students."
Dwight Read,NA,Hunting and Gathering Societies,ANTHRO 158,N/A,"Read is a academic speaker, so its really hard to stay awake in the class and he talks so fast its impossible to write notes. Dont waste time writing any books, nor buying them since 95% of exams are on the lecture. You dont need to go to lecture since everything he says is on the notes online. The sample exam he gives is very misleading, it caused me to get a B in the class. The questions are very simplified and easy on the sample exam and on the real exam they are in depth. Memorize the notes online and understand the major concepts. the exams are about 10t/f, 25 mult choice, and 3 short answers. you miss one short answer and you get a B on the exam. Midterm = 1/3 grade, paper = 1/3 grade, final = 1/3 grade. For the paper, you can choose from a 10 pg research paper throughout the course, or wait till the 10th week for a question to answer in 5 pages. The question prompts he gives are very very confusing and it drove me insane for days. I totally BS'ed my way through it. I personally regret not doing the paper, its longer but you have the whole quarter to do it and you have more options."
Dwight Read,NA,Hunting and Gathering Societies,ANTHRO 158,N/A,"Professor Read is a very nice man who truly cares about his students.  However, I found his class rather boring.  The midterm and 1/2 of the final were multiple choice, which I felt was an ineffective way to test knowledge about social systems.  I didn't put too much effort into the class and pulled a B+... I think an A would have been completely feasable, had I been more interested in the topic."
Dwight Read,NA,Hunting and Gathering Societies,ANTHRO 158,N/A,"Professor Read is a fine teacher, but those taking his courses should keep in mind a few facts.  First, he is a mathematical anthropologist, so while you won't be expected to do differential equations, you will be expected to demonstrate a good grasp of complex kinship and social patterns.  Secondly, his exams can be a bit tricky.  Make sure you have *all* the lecture notes for this class, in addition to reading the finer points in the text on social exchanges.  Overall, I learned a large amount of information in this class, and I consider it worthwhile, though it was by far my most difficult class to date.  If you're interested in getting an easy A, don't take this course.  If you're interested in applying yourself as an anthropologist, Professor Read is an excellent guide to that goal."
Barnett A Schlinger,NA,Neuroscience: From Molecules to Mind -- Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience,NEUROSC M101C,N/A,"His material was interesting, and he's a good lecturer. That being said, I thought his exam was too focused; the majority of the points coming from only two questions is fairly ridiculous (and I'm not simply being bitter, I actually did pretty well). And he didn't seem to care about students. At all."
Barnett A Schlinger,NA,Foundations in Physiological Science,PHYSCI 111B,N/A," Pros: - Goes at a slow pace making it easier to absorb - is clear and concise making the information very understandable- the material was very interesting and fun. Its hormones, so if your interested in endocrinology, youll love this module.  Cons: - can mumble and be monotone from time to time- uses the chalkboard for lecture, making it hard to read some of his writing and diagrams so SIT UP CLOSE and recording lectures will definitely help. I suggest doing it. - the questions on the midterm were very ambiguous and vague. So you really have to regurgitate everything you know from the lectures. Anything you think might be related to the question WRITE IT DOWN and make sure to write down the keywords associated with that question because the TAs grade based on those keywords. The test is out of 100 points, most being short answers, one long answer, and term definitions.  Overall, he's a great lecturer and worth taking the class with.  As for the entire Physci 111B, MAKE SURE YOU DO WELL IN YOUR DISCUSSIONS. if you do, they will help your grade tremendously considering it was a bigger portion of our grade and worth 120 points. Do well on the quizzes and critiques and dont just shrug off the points you get docked off for because they will build up. And also PARTICIPATE. The TA will not only give you points but it will help you stay on track with the material and help you absorb it better. These are supposed to be easy points, so take advantage of them.  For me, I was somehow able to get an A+ in the class, despite my horrendous experience in 111A and almost getting dropped from the major after getting a C. so for those afraid of going into 111B, I will say that the class is better and the material is much more interesting and enjoyable. BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO STUDY YOUR BUTT OFF.  "
Barnett A Schlinger,NA,Foundations in Physiological Science,PHYSCI 111B,N/A," Hi everyone. So I decided to be a nice guy and give some input the his section.  This is 2014 spring quarter. 111B was taught by B. Schlinger, A. Watson, Metzner. Schlinger taught the endocrine module. I personally enjoyed his teaching style. He is good ol' chalk and eraser type of lecturer.  Record his lecture and actually relisten to it! Write down everything he says (word for word pref). Then trim the fat (shit he mumbles). Bold the key phrases and think of those as points you would get on exams. (I wish someone told me this because I spent too much time rewriting shit down) (1) go to class and type notes...whenever he has pictures or diagrams you should make a note on the typed notes and draw the image on a piece of paper (2) relisten to lecture and finish typing his lecture up. (3) trim the fat and condense the notes so they are easy to look at. This shouldn't take too long since all you have to do is copy and paste into a nice format (my rule is one page per lecture) in the end you should have 5-6 pages of nice notes to review.  Exams:How I felt coming out: ""Damn that exam was so easy wtf"" Reality:78/100 (average 76/100) Explanation: He is the epitome of ""brain vomiting."" You have to cram everything in his lecture and vomit out answers. So how do you study for this exam? have a topic and practive writing down everything you can think of. Then grade yourself on how many points/ keyterms you mentioned on the relevant topic. They grade based on specific terms. They dgaf if it is right or wrong.  You have to meet the criteria. I studied a butt load...but so does everyone else... good luck haha"
Barnett A Schlinger,NA,Foundations in Physiological Science,PHYSCI 111B,N/A,"I like the way he lectures although he does mumble alot . I studied really hard for his test because I heard how he is nit picky. He asks some really vague questions which could have been answered multiple ways but just try to write everything you know. And some that focused on info we barely went over in class, but its a physci class sooo its gonna be hard "
Barnett A Schlinger,NA,Foundations in Physiological Science,PHYSCI 111C,N/A,"Stupid test format. You could spend 100 hours memorizing garbage but none of it will show up on the test. He looks for key words, its all by luck because theres no way to know what key words he looks for. Talks like a WWF announcer, can't write exams for shit, quizzes are useless. Good thing 111C is never being taught again. "
Barnett A Schlinger,NA,Foundations in Physiological Science,PHYSCI 111C,N/A,"Everyone ""likes"" his lectures, but if you take a minute to think about it, its terribly inefficient. Moves at a snail pace because he has to write everything down and draw all the pictures. What could be covered in 30 min is covered in 1 hour. discussions are mandatory and  smell like turd. his midterm suck the round things between my legs (i'm a guy). his entire exam is free response, and because they are standardized tests for 150 some students, they TAs look for key words and give points accordingly. spend hours memorizing details and forget about concepts to ace his tests. "
Laurie K Hart,NA,Globalization: Contemporary Issues,GLBL ST 100B,B,Hart is  a HORRIBLE lecturer. She literally is all over the place with her lectures. There is absolutely no sense of cohesion or some sort of narrative in her lectures. She talks about random case studies and random ideas and nothing makes any sense. And her tests are way too long for the time allotted and the paper prompts literally make no sense. Avoid taking her at ALL COSTS. One of the worst professors I have ever taken.
Laurie K Hart,NA,Globalization: Contemporary Issues,GLBL ST 100B,B+,"I agree with the previous review. The material was definitely interesting but Professor Hart is not a very good lecturer. She was often hard to follow at times and she spoke very broadly about concepts so it was pretty hard to make connections across a lot of them when it came time for the exams. The ""study guide"" she provided for both the midterm and final consisted of a crazy long list of terms (basically everything ever mentioned in lecture), so it was hard to know and prioritize what would be most important. The exams consisted of ID terms, short answers of 3-4 sentences, and then little essays of 2-3 paragraphs. The two paper assignments were relatively easy though. The first one (2-3 pages) had us go to an exhibit at Fowler and make a connection between an artifact and one of the terms from the course. The second paper (3 pages) had us find a current event going on somewhere across the world and connect it to any concepts that were discussed in two of the readings from the course. Discussion also mattered because attendance was taken and we were assigned to groups that would then present to the class on a specific week's readings. With a different professor, I think this class has the potential to be so much better than it was for us this past quarter."
Laurie K Hart,NA,Globalization: Contemporary Issues,GLBL ST 100B,B+,"There's so much potential (especially in this course!) for the material to be interesting and at times Hart hits the mark but, put quite simply, Hart is a BAD LECTURER.  The class includes 1 midterm, discussion participation, 2 essays, and a final. The midterm and essays are relatively essay. Discussion ranges by TA...some are tough graders so beware. Final hit me hard; there was a lot of information to memorize and Hart does a bad job of clearly explaining what students should prioritize. Consensus: Nice person, but avoid her GS 100B course if you can."
Abigail Ruth Levine,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A,"I took Anthro 8 with her, and honestly if given the option to go back in time, I would not take it again with her. There have been multiple instances where i've dozed off in lectures because all she does is read off the slides; hence, lectures are rather boring. She also expects you to do intense reading of the textbook, and there are just so many tiny, irrelevant details she tests you on. I'd say I put in a decent amount of effort into this class, but it wasn't enough to get an A. On the other hand, discussions were fun! Basically, if you're REALLY good at memorizing and mugging up a whole bunch of tiny details and information, then take this class. If you're not EXTREMELY good at memorization, DO NOT take this class with Levine. Anthro 8 is supposed to be an easy class, but with Levine it is the exact opposite. "
Abigail Ruth Levine,NA,Archaeology: Introduction,ANTHRO 8,N/A," Please don't take her. Just don't do it to yourself. Unless you want to take a class with a professor who sits and reads from the slides and expects you to then go off and memorize every single fact in the textbook and lectures that she ever mentioned, I would avoid her at all costs. ANTHRO 8 is supposedly easy but she made it horrible because of her absurd tests. The first midterm had a 70% average, the final didn't have a distribution, but the highest score I even heard of was a B+. The two papers they grade somewhat hard.  This is an UNCURVED CLASS. Which means that about  20 OUT OF 240 got A's and A-'s. That is bullshit.  I promise you that she is not at all a good professor and you will not get a good grade so please avoid her at all costs unless you like getting a B after working your ass off for a stupid GE. "
Abigail Ruth Levine,NA,Economic Anthropology,ANTHRO 143,N/A, I really enjoyed Economic Anthropology with Professor Levine. She is a great lecturer presenting information in an engaging manner often linking economic theory to contemporary situations or discussing her research in Peru without resorting to a powerpoint of holiday snaps! There was frequent engagement in discussion by most students enrolled and attendance was always high - surely a good sign. Both Professor Levine and her TA's are very fair markers and the questions for class papers are interesting and allow you to pick up marks by showing an understanding of the concepts. Readings were also pretty engaging on the whole.  I would definitely recommend this class and Professor Levine in general - I assume her other classes are equally worthwhile as her lecture style is a lot of fun and keeps you interested throughout.
Abigail Ruth Levine,NA,Evolution of Human Societies,ANTHRO 1530,N/A,Not a good professor.  She requires 8 expensive textbooks and also assigns tons of extensive journals to read.  
Ashley Micklos,NA,Selected Topics in Linguistic Anthropology,ANTHRO 159,C+,"Not a huge fan. She was intimidating on the first day, strictly warning students we wouldn't even be able to leave our house for our take-home midterm because it was going to be THAT rigorous. Well, she wasn't kidding. So, the subject matter is fascinating of course, but Micklo's instructions were not ever clear to me and many other students. Most of the class got a C or below on the midterm and students were LINED UP outside her office for office hours. This class is based on pure memorization of terms. I found myself working extremely hard only for her to continuously find deficiencies in my work without offering clear advice."
Kyeyoung Park,NA,Evolutionary Psychology,ANTHRO 124Q,N/A,"I took her Korean American experience class, which is not difficult. One midterm, paper, and take home final are easy. But to be honest, I think she is probably one of the worst Asian Am professors I've had. I thought that some of these reviews might be biased, but after taking her class I have to say some of the concerns are definitely spot on. Firstly, professor park makes very uncomfortable(if even borderline racist) remarks when comparing Koreans to other races. The worst is when she laughs after those remarks. I'm not sure if its a nervous laughter or uncontrollable, but seriously she needs to stop doing that. She alienates so many of her non-Asian students through her remarks and I saw almost half of them drop after the first week. Makes me really worried that she says she's going to be teaching a course on racism next quarter.Her lectures are meandering and most students can't even follow her reasoning. She ALWAYS goes past the lecture time, which is pretty inconsiderate of her since most students have other classes to attend.Also, she puts such a huge emphasis on the LA riot and Korean-latino relations because of her research and makes us do a bunch of unnecessary and irrelevant research on it too. She also provides so many readings that she will never discuss in class. She makes you read the manuscript for her book, which for the most part is convoluted and nobody cares about. Basically, a waste of my time taking this class."
Kyeyoung Park,NA,Korean American Experience,ASIA AM 132A,N/A," I am a senior Asian American studies double major with Psych. I have taken many classes in both fields and I LOVE Asian Am. However, this is the single worst class I have ever taken at UCLA. It is not hard or complicated, but the professor (Park) is absolutely awful. Not only does she not care about her students, and not encourage class discussion, her assignment to interview a ""latino customer"" person and a ""korean store owner"" is absolutely ridiculous and frankly was insulting because of the racial slurs and stereotypes it actually ENCOURAGED. Her lectures are biased and she displays hints of racism if not surface level biases that she attempts to brainwash the class with.  This class was insulting because she is racially insensitive and she frequently blurts out biased opinions in her pointed remarks. She has said stupid things like ""second generation koreans do not  study as much because they are more american,"" or ""what does it mean for koreans if they all become ministers"" (while laughing because she thinks they should ""become lawyers and doctors instead"").  Do not take this class or any other class with this professor, she does not represent anything related to Asian American studies because it is an amazing major. "
Kyeyoung Park,NA,Korean American Experience,ASIA AM 132A,B+,"I originally took this class because I needed extra units. This quarter I took 16 units and was in hope for something easy. This class had doable work but she graded harshly, gave no extra credit and honestly her lectures are heavily biased towards Korean Americans. Did not provide much clarity on what she is looking for in our research paper and did not round for borderline grades. What I would turn in would be A work for other professors but B work according to her. This professor and course honestly disappointed me. I wouldn’t recommend this class or this professor. Save yourself because it’s not an A and she won’t give you one even if you are 1% off."
Kyeyoung Park,NA,Korean American Experience,ASIA AM 132A,A,"I really recommend taking this class. Professor Park is very kind and always there for her students. She encourages everyone to do their best and creates a welcoming environment in her class. There are 3 take-home assignments; the midterm essay, interview project, and final essay. All of which are fair as the Professor provides all the articles she wants students to use in the assignments. The professor also had guest speakers in class which were very nice to hear from. I recommend this class!"
Kyeyoung Park,NA,Constructing Race,ANTHRO M144P,A-," This class was very....interesting, and I was admittedly hesitant going into it due to the other reviews.  The class required one midterm and one paper throughout the quarter. The midterm was a series of short answer questions, and she gave very conflicting answers on how she wanted it to be graded. I would say hit every point she mentions on the midterm exam sheet and you should be okay. The final paper was an ethnographic style analysis of a topic of your choice related to COVID-19 and race (again, the directions were kind of vague, but TA tried his best to break things down.)  For lectures: It was extremely hard to follow along in lectures, because not only does she use outdated language (ex. 'the Blacks were very upset by..) but the presentation slides used were overall non-cohesive and unclear. Essentially, she is repeating everything from the reading. Attendance is occasionally checked.  Reading: I would say do as much of the reading as you can leading up to the midterm, but then after that, you can focus on the material pertaining to your paper. Fortunately, the reading topics themselves are clear and engaging, and I did get a more in-depth perspective of the LA riots (the book that she wrote.)  I feel like sticking to the (very much so outdated) reading helped a lot, albeit a little repetitive by the end of the quarter.  Overall workload: It is manageable, just make sure you run the directions past your TA as for what they are looking for in your papers because following along with the professor is very confusing. As someone with a heavy courseload and student-worker, I got through the quarter without dedicating an unfair portion of time. This class felt a bit tedious but not unmanageable."
Kyeyoung Park,NA,Constructing Race,ANTHRO M144P,A," grading scheme (total 120 points):participation 30 ptsmidterm 60 ptsfinal 30 pts TL;DR: don't take this class with this prof dr. park gave unclear instructions for everything. participation rules were foggy beginning week 3 when she returned the class in person; no one was clear on what they had to do to receive full participation points. she also changed the participation rules at least once which made it even more confusing. the midterm rules, which should have been straightforward, were made unclear by her. for the final, she was incredibly unclear on what EXACTLY she wanted to see. are we required to interview 3 people? do we have to do participant observation? both/neither? do we have to turn in field notes/transcripts? no clue. the burden was on TAs to decide, so each TA gave their students different instructions. it was incredibly stressful to put our projects together for this reason. additionally, even though she 1. offered a zoom meeting during lecture, 2. recorded the zoom meeting and posted it on bruinlearn, 3. uploaded lecture slides, and 4. only lectured on reading material adding nothing new, she required in person participation. there was no check of symptom monitoring surveys, no mask requirement, nothing. she required us all to risk our health to receive no new information and an unengaging lecture. there was no need to have in person requirements for lectures because there was no activities. there was no reason to go other than she wants it that way. the cherry on top is that the final project was supposed to be due friday of week 10. people asked for it to be moved so she moved it to monday of finals week. that's fine, no complaints. then she moved it to friday of finals week, so we were all really happy! fast forward to thursday of week 9 and she says it's due monday of finals week again. once again, flip flopping between instructions and putting the brunt on TAs, who were kind enough to allow extensions to those of us who had planned out our project around the friday due date. she also had everyone do their evaluations in class two days before she did this, so most people could not even include this detail in their evals. sick behavior."
Kyeyoung Park,NA,Constructing Race,ANTHRO M144P,A+,"Prof Park is a great professor. The time that I took this class was during the protests, and she and her TAs were accommodated students by cancelling the final. Her exams were essay format with page maximums and a lot of questions to answer. Get familiar with the material before exams are due in order to write short, yet very specific, responses."
Kyeyoung Park,NA,Constructing Race,ANTHRO M144P,A,"This class was easy, straightforward, and had a light workload. The lectures were dry, but Professor Park posts the lecture slides on CCLE before the midterm and final so we can use them while studying for the exam. Going to class wasn't very helpful, and I only went because Park takes attendance (which counts in your grade). She assigns very long readings, and I didn't bother doing them. In addition to participation, your grade is also based on a midterm and final, which are both short essay style. She gives the study guide a week before the exams and the exam is based on the readings. I would only do the readings mentioned on the study guide and take notes on them for the short essays.  This strategy worked well for me. The midterm is in class but the final exam is take home."
Kyeyoung Park,NA,Constructing Race,ANTHRO M144P,N/A,"I thought she was a very good professor! Probably one of the best I've had at UCLA. She actually makes me want to pursue Social Anthropology for grad school!I don't know why people are saying her lectures are disorganised because that is the complete opposite from my experience. It is in fact super organised and she even pauses briefly to allow people to finish copying down her slides before she starts talking. Genius!She gave out the questions for the exams ahead of time so we could prepare. She even briefed us days before so we would know exactly what she wanted to see in our essays.Also, I don't know why someone claimed her grading is hard because she gave me a 100% on my midterm, which she also gave to a handful of people in my class. It might just be my first 100% on a blue book ever!The grading was 40/60 midterm/final. The midterm was an in-class bluebook and the final was a take home. Pretty straight forward essay questions, which I liked. Not at all designed to confuse you. She also bumped grades up with extra credit for attendance, which everyone else liked.Her research on Race is pretty cool. She even created a linear model the outlined race relations! If you need some solid background in Social Anthropology, I think this class is essential.Yes, her accent is thick, but still very understandable. And I'm deaf on one ear. Also, come on people, you're Anthropologists; don't mock people with accents. SMH!!"
Kyeyoung Park,NA,Constructing Race,ANTHRO M144P,N/A,Graded fairly hard on exams.  Class average was low and was not curved unless we all did bad on final.  Lectures were long and went over the readings.  Had to do readings to do well though becasue she asked super detailed exam questions.
Kyeyoung Park,NA,Urban Anthropology,ANTHRO 146,N/A,"prof park is extremely intelligent, but often misunderstood. if you have a knack for understanding accents, there shouldn't be much of a problem taking one of her classes. i would still say to make sure you get a good TA that can emphasis her points and the material. Also, prof park showed concern for students to do well and is a very nice person in general."
Kyeyoung Park,NA,Urban Anthropology,ANTHRO 146,N/A,"Since there is no real verbal feedback about this professor yet, I will blaze the trail. I have her currently for Anthro 167 and all I have to say is if you are considering taking a class of hers: don't. I can't really attack her for her speaking skills, as she is from Korea which makes her quite difficult to understand, but I CAN attack the content and style of her lectures. Basically, they are pointless to go to as they are just a summary of the readings for the week. And she has trouble explaining basic concepts in the readings. I feel more confused at the conclusion of a lecture than I do at the beginning. Though she is an extremely nice woman, she falls short of being an effective professor."
Kyeyoung Park,NA,Constructing Race,AF AMER M159P,A,"Never take a class with this professor. This class was infuriating, and not because you learn about racism – the professor does not know how to teach. I have never wanted to drop out of a class so badly."
Kyeyoung Park,NA,Constructing Race,ASIA AM M169,A,"Professor Park is not at all a great professor, and I would not recommend taking her. She obviously is well-educated within her area of expertise, but that does not translate to how she teaches. Her lectures are incredibly confusing and do not follow a set theme, she does not listen well to student feedback (although she claims that she does), and she kept changing course requirements well into the quarter. She somehow made an interesting topic like Constructing Race incredibly grueling."
D Rudner,NA,Selected Topics in Regional Cultures,ANTHRO 169,A,"*THIS REVIEW IS FOR ANTHRO 9*Truly Truly Rudner is possibly the most unclear and un-engaging professor I have ever had. He frequently goes on tangents that are not relevant to the course and his powerpoints are boring. By powerpoints I mean the really subpar notes he crudely wrote in a word document that has such small font that most people can't read it. Honestly, you will probably get a decent grade in the class because your TA knows how clueless Rudner is and will take pity on you; it's not even a particularly difficult class, it is just so horrendously organized. Just don't take Anthro 9 with Rudner, it will absolutely not be fun."
D Rudner,NA,Selected Topics in Regional Cultures,ANTHRO 169,N/A,"**HEADS UP THIS REVIEW IS FOR ANTHRO 9**TAKE ANTHRO 9 WITH ANY OTHER PROFESSOR!! AVOID RUDNER AT ALL COSTS!!! I don't know what I could have possibly done during my lifetime to end up with a professor as horrible and incompetent as Rudner but it must have been something pretty bad. This man has a phd in PHILOSOPHY. I have absolutely no idea why he was considered to teach this course. He has an attitude when it comes to answering questions and 99% of the time he doesn’t answer the question at all, expecting his students to figure out what he has to say. This class is much too specific for an introductory anthro class about culture and society.  We spent half the quarter on the history of cultural anthropology. That’s fair. But the second half was entirely spent on the Trobriand Islands and very specific aspects of the Trobriand Islands too. One plus side is the fact that there are no in class exams, only take home papers (2 papers and a final paper worth 20%, 20%, and 25%). BUT when you are expected to write papers about the Trobriand Islands and end up talking about South India 70% of the time in class when he isn’t trying to spend an excessive amount of time trying to figure out the “iClicker technology”...I don’t know what to tell you. TA's will most likely take pity on you, they took pity on us. Honestly I learned everything from my TA. The last part of the quarter you read a book about HIV/AIDS in the Trobriand Islands which is way too specific for an introductory class. People stayed for the first 20 minutes only for the clicker questions and then slowly started leaving."
D Rudner,NA,Selected Topics in Regional Cultures,ANTHRO 169,F,"***THIS REVIEW IS FOR ANTHRO 9***For all that is good in this world, do not take this class with this professor. It was by far the worst class I have taken during my time at UCLA. This class was the definition of a joke. This was supposed to be an intro to cultural and social anthropology, but we spent the better half of the quarter focused on the Trobriand Islands and their culture...that is too specific for an introduction course. It got to the point of being irrelevant, and the work was highly uninteresting. The professor would often be teaching for a while and then suddenly say that he is not sure whether he has the information right or not. He even had the gall to say that he arrived unprepared for lecture and then proceeded to read his lecture to us from a write up he brought. After a couple lectures, people started to just show up for the in-class quizzes and then leave right after. The in-class quizzes were also impossibly specific at times, even for those who did the readings. He would focus on irrelevant details instead of concepts that seemed important. The TAs would agree with us, but there's not much they can do in that regard. Thankfully, there were no in-class midterms or finals, but rather 2 take home midterm exams that were 6-8 pages, as well as a take home final that was also a 6-8 page paper. Many people complained about the prompt for the final essay because it seemed redundant, and he of course would not be willing to change or make it clearer. Although he is an old man and you tend to want to feel sorry for him, the waste of time and money doesn't excuse his lack of professionalism and presentation. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR IF YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOOD FOR YOU."
Bonnie Taub,NA,Fiat Lux Freshman Seminars,LATN AM 19,N/A," IA STD 50B+I went to her office hour and waited for 50 minutes before she came... Don't take her If you HAVE to take this class, make sure take it with lots of friends and divide up the reading and study together because it's a lot of reading and books to buy. "
Bonnie Taub,NA,Introduction to Latin America,I A STD 50,F,"It's an easy GE alright, but that doesn't mean you get to slack off and space out during lecture. Professor Taub does uses slides, but they're very bare and offer little to no information needed for the exams. If you scour hard enough, you can find the textbook and books online, but personally I bought both required novels. It's important to pay attention to what she says in lecture, and especially the videos she shows in class. Professor Taub herself is very sweet and caring about her students. She even gave us a 5 day extension for submitting our take-home midterm because many students emailed her saying the deadline was too early. The course content itself is heavily focused on Latin American issues, culture, and major events, so you're expected to know a little historical context from the textbook. Other than that, I regretted not being able to take this course during in-person, as I'm sure Professor Taub is wonderful to get to know in-person."
Bonnie Taub,NA,Introduction to Latin America,I A STD 50,A,"Bonnie is by far one the best professors I've had at UCLA. This class is very easy and the topic is interesting. The midterm was easy as long as you read the assigned book, skimmed the textbook and went to class regularly. The paper assignment is long, but relatively easy and pretty much everyone in the class got an A on it. Bonnie is clearly passionate about Latin America and makes this class applicable to all majors by including political, medical, anthropological (etc) topics to the class."
Bonnie Taub,NA,Introduction to Latin America,I A STD 50,A," here's all you need to know about Prof. Taub.PROS:- she is a really nice, considerate professor- she extends deadlines if the class is at consensus- class goes by pretty fast, not boring at allCONS: - HEAVY reading - 2 chapters per week (approx. 150 pages) + two essay questions - read one news article per week, write a reflection - multiple books (100-300 pages) to be read throughout the quarter (on your own)- multiple films (1-3 hours) to be watched (on your own) - you better do all that bc the test is on everything above + all her slides + you must know all the countries and landmarks on a map of Latin AmericaBTW the midterm was 12 pages long (multiple choice, short answer, AND one essay question)  so basically....she is a genuinely good person who is considerate of her students BUT her workload is questionable to say the least. good luck friend! - a fellow bruin"
Bonnie Taub,NA,Introduction to Latin America,I A STD 50,A,"Professor Taub is easily one of the nicest, most passionate professors I've had at UCLA. Her work in the field is super interesting and hugely diverse, and she has a lot to say about her experiences and is very knowledgable about the subjects covered in IA STD 50. A lot of the topics covered in this class are super interesting and will definitely open your eyes and make you think. That being said, there is a lot of reading for this class. The tests are decently in depth, and there is definitely a lot of material to understand along with a lot of things to memorize. The interview research paper also was a ton of work, and took a couple of weeks at least to gather all the facts and data you need, interview your subject, make sure of its accuracy, and actually write the paper. Even though this research paper was super involved and difficult at times, it was genuinely very interesting to learn from a first hand account. It makes you realize the themes and subjects you are studying in class are present in the experiences of someone right in front of you, and humanizes everything this class stresses over the course of the quarter."
Bonnie Taub,NA,Introduction to Latin America,I A STD 50,A,"I absolutely loved learning about Latin America, but I felt like Professor Taub's lectures were not super helpful towards the midterm and final. I enjoyed this class too because there was no discussion, which actually might have been helpful to have. In all honesty, you do need the textbook for this class. But don't fear. It should be on course reserves in the library. I didn't have to buy mine because of this. There is a lot of content to go over, but it isn't too understand. Professor Taub does create a brief study guide list. Most of the questions on the exams are pretty specific, therefore it is important to read from the textbook. I believe that for every lecture section (2x a week) we had to turn in a printed copy of a current news event on a country in Latin America and write a brief summary of the article and some thoughts. Professor Taub is very sweet, but she is a bit forgetful. She also never claims to know everything which is great compared to other professors. She also speaks a whole bunch of languages and has worked abroad. There is a pretty long essay we have to write where we interviewed someone who has lived in a country in Latin America and discuss their experiences and how they coincide with the events at that time. I recommend doing this as soon as possible because the essay does require a lot of time and research to be accurate. As long as you did all the readings (or just skimmed the main points) and the essay to your best abilities, it is highly likely that you will get and A."
Bonnie Taub,NA,Introduction to Latin America,I A STD 50,A,"Professor Taub is not only a great professor but also a super sweet person. It's easy to tell that she is very passionate about what she teaches and she is very willing to help students understand and learn the material well. There are frequent homework assignments and lecture attendance is taken through those homeworks, the assignments are all super helpful in understanding the material. The exams are not too challenging as long as you pay attention to lecture and ask Professor Taub if you have any questions. She'll go over it as many times needed too! She's great!!"
Bonnie Taub,NA,Introduction to Latin America,I A STD 50,A,"This was my favorite class Winter Quarter! Professor Taub is a really kind woman, and an engaging lecturer. The midterm was super easy, and the final paper, which was an ethnographic interview/research paper on change in Latin America, was actually fun to write. The novels she assigns make up most of the exams, but they are short and interesting reads. She also allows for three extra credit assignments, which require you to do anything related to Latin America (read a book, listen to a song, watch a movie, visit a museum, etc.) and write a half-page response to it. Overall, I highly recommend this class and Professor Taub!"
Bonnie Taub,NA,Introduction to Latin America,I A STD 50,N/A,"Coming into this class, I knew little about Latin America. I am much more open minded and informed about the subject after taking this class. I really enjoyed Professor Taub as a person. Her lectures were engaging and she had so many diverse personal experiences to share with us. She does give extra credit, which helps a lot. Here is a breakdown:Class Attendance is important! You have to turn in an article every class to earn your attendance marks. Although she does upload her powerpoint to CCLE, she will put very general words like 'anthropology' or 'Mayans'... which does help at all unless you are in lecture.Midterm was a breeze if you read the books and went to lecture. However, the final intensely focused on material in the textbook. It was kind of a surprise. The books are necessary!!! Buy them and read them!!!Although this class was the most work I've done for a GE, it really was not that bad. I would take it again just because Professor Taub was so lovely and engaging."
Bonnie Taub,NA,Introduction to Latin America,I A STD 50,A,"Dr. Taub was great, I really loved her as a person. She was incredibly sweet. Her class was awesome, we learned so much about Latin America, and she had many first hand experiences to share with us. We did read a lot, but the work load was not that bad. Overall I had a great experience with her."
Bonnie Taub,NA,Introduction to Latin America,I A STD 50,A,Learned a lot about Latin America which I was otherwise ignorant before. Really friendly and funny professor. Not a harsh grader at all. Material is engaging and relevant. One of my fav professors at UCLA. Easy A as long as you out the work in which doesn't take that much effort. Many extra credit events to attend which she greatly appreciates and rewards you for. 10/10 recommend this professor and class
Bonnie Taub,NA,Intergroup Dialogue: Peer Dialogue,COM HLT 60,N/A," IA STD 50B+Worst.She is nice. But she was gone for 3 weeks and gave us midterm on week 6 saying ""not all the things we covered in the class will be on the midterm.""One thing we did do in class a lot was watch documentaries which we were tested on.WTFShe is extremely unorganized.Her powerpoints slides are just sad.She didn't even let us know our midterm grades until the final grades came out... so we didn't know how well we did on the midterm until we got our final grade. Don't take any class with Bonnie."
Bonnie Taub,NA,Introduction to Community Health Sciences,COM HLT 100,N/A,"cant say that it was the most interesting class ive taken, but it was definitely one of the most laid back classes i have had. i never really stressed out about it. the material was easy if u just memorize all the slides and slightly pay attention in lecture, mostly to her lectures since the guest lecturers were sometimes boring and we werent as heavily tested on them. this class can either get u a really good grade or a really bad one. dont think its easy enough to just not study because u MUST memorize everything if u want to tackle her test, which isnt hard since the material itself is easy and very understandable. much of it is common sense just talking about poverty and how it affects peoples health. u do need the books because she will ask some questions about specific studies from the books but she will tell you what they are on her study guides..etc."
Bonnie Taub,NA,"Health, Disease, and Health Services in Latin America",COM HLT 132,A-," Biggest qualm with this class has to be the exam. There was only one final exam for the whole quarter, which was nice to not have a midterm, but I felt that the questions were really specific and focused on statistics and random knowledge memorization (ie. prevalence of diseases per country). There was some multiple choice and some free response but I ended the class not sure where my grade would land because I definitely guessed on some. And it's not like more studying would have helped me, I did review a lot of material and some questions that were asked simply were not emphasized in class. There were also 2 papers which were .. doable I suppose?  Dr. Taub is a decently nice person, but for some reason doesn't like it when students take notes on iPads or laptops. This was discouraging because there were instances where activities were only allowed to be submitted on paper and students were told in class to put their note-taking devices away (to ensure we wouldn't be distracted during class). I felt this policy was strange and left many students staring at the slides, unable to take notes or retain much information from the 3 hour seminar. Also the way individual lectures were structured was disorganized and didn't facilitate much discussion (which I was hoping to experience from a class of only 20 people) but a list of words on a blank white slide did little to fully illustrate the magnitude of suffering and health problems in Latin America. Small point but it also felt like the ""savior complex"" was promoted in a couple lectures and that just didn't feel right. If you have other options, I'd only recommend to take this class if you're really passionate about Latin America, natural disasters, etc. Food is mentioned but I feel that the class is more about structural issues and disease than malnutrition."
Bonnie Taub,NA,"Health, Disease, and Health Services in Latin America",COM HLT 132,A," Professor Taub is an expert in Latin American health studies.  Her expertise provides  wonderful insight to this course.   Workload entailed a midterm essay on a health problem of our interest and take-home final assignment.  Textbook was interesting, but not necessary.  Additional books, i.e. Farmer's Haiti After the Earthquake, however, were a fascinating read and very relevant throughout the class."
Bonnie Taub,NA,"Health, Disease, and Health Services in Latin America",COM HLT 132,A,"Dr. Taub is an amazing lecturer. She is passionate about Latin American health, and gives engaging lectures. I strongly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in public health  or pursing a career in the health field. There is a lot of reading in this class, but it is really interesting. If I could, I would love to take another class with her. She truly cares about her students, and she can be a great mentor!"

Bonnie Taub,NA,"Health, Disease, and Health Services in Latin America",COM HLT 132,N/A,"I loved prof Taub.  She is such a nice and caring professor, something which I find rare at UCLA.  She really wants her students to learn the material, and she makes it very easy to enjoy learning it.  Though the class is 3 hours, we normally got out after 2 hrs and 15 min.  There are a lot of guest lecturers, but most of them are pretty interesting and they bring a lot of diversity to the class.  The class is pretty easy, but I still ended up learning a ton.  I would definitely recommend both her and the class."
Bonnie Taub,NA,"Health, Disease, and Health Services in Latin America",COM HLT 132,N/A,"Prof. Taub is a wonderful lecturer. She organizes a lot of guest lecturers to come in and talk about the health issues that are usually overlooked in your Daily Bruin.  She's very concerned about student learning, approachable for office hours, and cares about her students.  Don't slack in this class, you'll be missing out on interesting lectures and dialogues.  Midterm paper isn't bad, and the getting the general concept of major health issues and important names will help you for the final.  Visit her office and appreciate how much knowledge/kindness she has to offer."
Michelle Rensel,NA,Biotechnology and Society,SOC GEN M71A,B," The first quarter of the class focuses so. much. on GMOs (I should've known, considering the GMO game is a big part of the class). The game made the class super fun :) You got to be in a big group project and schedule meetings yourselves.  The workload is manageable,  but there'd be reading like every other day. + There would be extra credit readings, too! The tests were what lowered my grade in the class, and I wish I had studied more :( However, Professor Rensel is SUPER ACCOMMODATING, so nothing was her fault, LOL!"
Michelle Rensel,NA,Biotechnology and Society,SOC GEN M71A,A,"Rensel was one of the best professors in the cluster. Simply it is because she totally knows what she is doing and she totally knows what she is saying. She is direct and to the point without the need to give extra unnecessary information.  This makes her lectures quick and easy to follow. She offers tons of office hours, but didn't find myself going simply because I had no questions to ask since she explained everything nicely and clearly.  Her readings that she assigns are quick and easy to follow."
Michelle Rensel,NA,Biotechnology and Society,SOC GEN M71A,A,"For the Biotech & Society cluster, Rensel's lectures are the best because she completely goes over all the readings and makes them super easy to understand. She also holds tons of office hours if needed and is overall a super efficient, engaging and easy to understand prof."
Michelle Rensel,NA,Biotechnology and Society,CLUSTER M71A,A," Strongly recommend the cluster with this prof. In my opinion, she was the clearest professor I've had so far at UCLA and a terrific lecturer in this cluster.  As a non-bio (or STEM) major, I've been able to follow and understand all of Prof. Rensell's lectures to the T. They are clear, concise, and the learning objectives and structure of her lectures help people follow along and know exactly what knowledge we need to learn for the final exam.  Terrific professor!"
Michelle Rensel,NA,Biotechnology and Society,CLUSTER M71A,A+," To preface my review, a cluster is a team-taught general education course for freshman. I will also leave reviews on the co-professors for this class. Dr. Rensel was a wonderful lecturer, who always made her topics (relating more to the biological aspects of the course) enjoyable. Her test questions are always the most reasonable on the test, and her grading is straightforwards. It is sometimes easy to put off her assigned readings if you get bored easily. Overall, if you're interested in biotech, bioethics, or are just an engineer hoping to knock out all their GEs in one fell swoop, I would highly recommend this course."
Michelle Rensel,NA,Biotechnology and Society,CLUSTER M71A,A,"If you are going to take a cluster, take this one!!! Interesting material, lenient grading considering almost half your grade ends up being made up of participation in the discussions, the GMO game, and homework readings (all of which you should get 100 on if you are keeping up with the basic work). The work load is pretty manageable, we have readings but they are pretty short compared to other clusters. Midterms and finals are sometimes slightly difficult but very fair and clear. Also 1% of extra credit is offered by doing pretty basic extra workRensel is the best professor in this cluster. She is super clear, organized, friendly, and just makes her material a lot more straightforward than the other lecturers."
Michelle Rensel,NA,Biotechnology and Society,CLUSTER M71A,A+,"I thoroughly recommend this Cluster course. Professor Rensel is very knowledgeable and kind; the format of the class is very conducive to a student's life, combining weekly assignments with larger projects. The material of the Cluster is fascinating, dealing with topics from STEM that relate directly to society, a marriage that is very engaging and was novel to me."
Michelle Rensel,NA,Biotechnology and Society,CLUSTER M71A,A,"Hands down one of, if not, THE best professor I've had for fall quarter here in UCLA. Her lectures are very very digestible and easy to comprehend, her slides are very concise but complete with all the important points you need to understand from each topic. She is also very engaging in her lectures making it very easy to pay attention for the whole duration of it. She is always willing and open to questions in lectures and/or office hours. + a bonus is that her topics in the cluster were very interesting to look at! Definitely recommend this professor."
Michelle Rensel,NA,Biotechnology and Society,CLUSTER M71A,A,"Professor Rensel was my absolute favorite part of this class. Her lectures covered some pretty challenging biological concepts in a very straightforward way, although this may be difficult for non-science majors. She was super friendly and helpful in office hours, and genuinely cares about her students. Her readings were the shortest and the most to-the-point compared to the other professors, and she really prepared us well for her portions of the tests."
Michelle Rensel,NA,Biotechnology and Society,CLUSTER M71A,A,"I took this cluster because it is one of the few that satisfies not only 4 GE requirements, but also fulfills the Diversity and Writing II requirements. Overall, Dr. Rensel is a very engaging professor who is always willing to clarify concepts, answer questions, and provide extra help outside of class. There is one midterm each quarter at the beginning of the fourth week, and the information is very straightforward and mirrors the learning goals and outcomes provided in lecture almost exactly. I would highly recommend this class to any freshman who wants to get a lot of GEs out of the way!"
Michelle Rensel,NA,Biotechnology and Society,CLUSTER M71A,A+,"I am going to agree with many of the people on BruinWalk with my assessment of Dr. Rensel. I thought she was a great professor and and even better person. I may be biased in that I prefer science professors, but she was better than all of the ones I have had before. Her lectures were as straight forward as possible, and she helped all students understand. She led the review sessions and did a great job answering questions. She also genuinely cared about how the students did, and her tests were fair. Overall, she did a great job!"
Michelle Rensel,NA,Biotechnology and Society,CLUSTER M71A,A+,"Dr. Rensel is the positive energy of the Biotech Cluster. She has a good sense of humor, good at explaining concepts. and makes the most comprehensible slides (legible and organized). The class itself is not bad either. 25% final, 20% midterm, 10% weekly quizzes, 20% participation (basically free points), and 25% GMO games (it's similar to MUN). A clicker is required btw. The class is sort of reading-intensive, yet as long as you pay attention during lectures and revisit them before exams, you should be fine. Would take again."
Michelle Rensel,NA,Biotechnology and Society,CLUSTER M71A,N/A,"Professor Rensel gives the most comprehensible lectures out of all the M71 cluster professors. Her material can be a bit technical (at least for non-Biology students), but put in a couple of hours and you'll realize it's pretty easy under all the gloss. The courseload is not that heavy, if you complete your quizzes and homework in time, and the lectures are pretty engaging. The discussion sessions are my favorite part-- they get really interactive and extremely fun. 10/10 would recommend this cluster (esp Prof Rensel) to all fellow Bio-nerds out there!"
Michelle Rensel,NA,Biotechnology and Society,CLUSTER M71A,N/A,"Dr. Rensel teaches the biology part of this class, and only appears like 4 times as lecturer, but she makes the clearest slides and explanations of the three professors. She takes time for detailed illustration of many confusing concepts and encourages us to talk in groups if clicker answers diverge. She assigns the least reading among the professors, and they can be easy if you have learned AP biology."
Michelle Rensel,NA,Biotechnology and Society,CLUSTER M71A,N/A,Professor Rensel is awesome. She is very clear and helpful and her assigned readings are usually short and beneficial. She is the best professor out of the three that teach this class.
Michelle Rensel,NA,Biotechnology and Society,CLUSTER M71A,A-," A lot of people are going to tell you that clusters are not worth it and a lot of work. Honestly, the workload is not that much (at least for this cluster), there's just a lot of readings. You can probably get away without doing the readings since most of the questions on the exams are taken from lectures. However, the readings do help you understand a lot of the material talked about in lecture, so that is really up to you. The midterms and finals consist of multiple choice and short answer questions. If you can answer every learning outcome from every lecture and remember the answer, I can guarantee you will get at least a 90%. I personally recommend clusters if you are not into humanities because it gives you writing 2 credit and knocks out a good number of GEs and also fulfills the diversity requirement. I really hate writing essays and there is only one major paper every quarter. A usual UCLA writing class has 3 essays a quarter, and since clusters are year long classes, the 3 essays are spread out between the 3 quarters, which puts less stress into any one of your quarters if you are really slow and bad at writing essays like me. The seminar in spring quarter is a little more writing intensive, but it is still only one major paper plus a bunch of small pass/no pass writing assignments. The nice thing about it though is that the seminars only meet once a week and there is no midterm/final, much like your typical UCLA writing class. For some people, like me, who would rather take midterms and finals, that may be a little more actual work, but for others, the spring quarter is the most chill because some people can actually BS their way through the small writing assignments.  Just like what you might also hear from others, take a cluster that you would actually enjoy. I am a science major and even though this GE only gives me 3 GE credits that I actually need (because 1 of them is a life science GE), I did not ever regret taking this cluster. I absolutely think that everything I learned in this course was so interesting and learned so much from it. The topics that are addressed in this cluster include GMOs, breast cancer, in vitro fertilization, DIY science, and a few more other topics. It brings another perspective to science that you may have never thought about, for example, ethical issues, social, political, etc. This is probably the most scientific a humanities class can ever get for a south campus major. So for all you freshmen out there, if you are interested in taking a cluster, I suggest going through each one and reading all the descriptions about them and see which one catches your eye. Of course, weigh out the pros and cons because some clusters have a lot of science GEs, which you may or may not need, and vice versa. For me, this cluster was the one that I thought would be interesting plus it gives GEs that cannot be fulfilled by any of my other prereqs.  One thing to note about for this cluster is that your TA has a good amount of power towards your grade. During fall quarter, I had a pretty harsh TA and although I aced both the midterm and final, I ended up with an A- because the TA graded me pretty harshly on the stuff she gives grades to (I am definitely not a slacker and I put in a lot of time and effort into my work but still got low Bs). I highly recommend Evelyn if she is going to be a TA again. I switched to her winter quarter and got an A. She is fun, interesting, and super nice and approachable. She understands her students and actually enjoys teaching and is good at it, most importantly, a very fair and not harsh grader. Discussions are almost 2 hours long but her discussions are always super interesting and relevant to the class. In the spring I was in Professor Rensel's seminar about GMOS. Pretty interesting but I mainly chose that one because I personally think Professor Rensel is the best professor in the cluster plus having a professor is probably more safe than a TA. But then again, the spring seminar focuses on a special topic of the cluster, so choosing a seminar you are interested in is important too.  Overall, I wouldn't say this cluster is ""easy"", but it is definitely worth taking if you are interested in science and/or biotechnology. Especially for science majors who want to avoid as many humanities classes as possible, this cluster is a really good blend of humanities and science. Definitely super fair class. Professor Lee has some pretty unfocused lectures, but as far as I recall, the exams don't have a lot of material from her lectures. Theres usually only 1 or 2 main points from Professor Lee's lectures even though they are really long so try to figure out which things are important (it is usually the broader stuff rather than the details she will give). Professor Rensel definitely is the most clear and if you do end up taking the cluster, you will understand you don't even need to worry about Professor Rensel's material. Panofsky and Le Goff is kind of the middle ground where the concepts are not just laid out for you but you need to do a little thinking on your side. Definitely doable cluster and if you're sincerely interested in it and put work into it, you can get an A."
Michelle Rensel,NA,Biotechnology and Society,CLUSTER M71A,F,"Professor Rensel, unlike other professors in the cluster, uses the Learning outcomes very clearly and specifically, so that when it comes to the revision for finals, you'll never have a problem figuring out what exactly you need to know for her part of the course. Although she might come off as strict and intimidating in the first few lectures, with time you realize she's super sweet and cool. She explains everything very well and detailed, doesn't go over time and makes sure to she answers all questions that you might have. Probably the best of the 4 professors you'll have in the cluster!"
Michelle Rensel,NA,Biotechnology and Society,CLUSTER M71A,A-,Professor Rensel gives great lectures. I really liked the topics she covered in the cluster and her material was very interesting. She was also super helpful in her explanations of complex biological mechanisms. She made the class easy for me.The workload is super heavy though. There's a lot of reading assigned for each lecture. I wouldn't say this class is an easy A.
Michelle Rensel,NA,Biotechnology and Society,SOC GEN M71B,A+,"Considering the amount of reading that you do in the class, Dr. Rensel sure made it a lot better. She was such a kind soul, and she was understanding of the circumstances. Her test questions also made you think, but they were fair overall. Her lectures were probably the best part."
Michelle Rensel,NA,Biotechnology and Society,CLUSTER M71B,A-,"I loved taking this cluster with Rensel. She taught it with Panofsky and Lee during my quarter and they're all great in my opinion. I took the first two quarters in person, which was very entertaining and informative. The information is very interesting and applicable to exams. If you go to class, exams are a breeze with a quick review. The class is somewhat tedious with assignments, but are most definitely manageable. They are not difficult or time-consuming. Just a lot that I often forgot about. If you keep on top of these, you'll definitely get an A. Rensel was incredibly accommodating and personable. Before classes were remote, the professors all held lunch office hours to encourage students to stop and drop by. Would definitely recommend this cluster to freshman who are interested in biotech."
Michelle Rensel,NA,Biotechnology and Society: Special Topics: Hormonal Bodies: Hormones as Culprits and Cures in 21st Century,CLUSTER M71CW,N/A,"I don't have enough good things to say about Dr. Rensel and the Hormones seminar. She's a very sweet, knowledgeable lady who is always willing to listen, offer advice, etc. I got sick on the final presentation day and she was super understanding about it, which is not common in teachers around finals time. The course content was super interesting and felt intentionally chosen / hand selected. We covered so many topics that I would not have known about and I really felt like my perspective and understanding of multiple controversial issues became more nuanced and educated. The course load was manageable, a few readings and activities a week for a once a week class session. I felt like it was all teaching me something new, so I usually didn't mind doing it. We were also provided plenty of resources to learn how to use UCLA research resources, which I think will help me throughout my years at school. That made doing our research paper much easier and smoother. I'm not yet sure what grade I received, but I don't doubt it will be high thanks to her timely inputting of assignment grades and a fair grade distribution between assignments, participation, and the paper."
Domenico Ingenito,NA,Gender and Sexuality in Arts and Literatures of Iran and Middle East,IRANIAN 55,A," IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN ENJOYABLE, INSIGHTFUL ""EASY"" GE, TAKE THIS COURSE.  This class is by far my favorite course in the humanities I've taken at UCLA. I'm so happy I took it. The content was SO interesting and the course was really laid back which is what I needed during this stressful remote quarter.   Professor Ingenito is a brilliant professor who really cares about his students and it shows. He's so nice and approachable and he's insanely knowledgeable about the topics in the course, but what mattered to me was that he was able to breakdown complex concepts and gave us the foundation to analyze the works  in the class. The first few weeks were like a crash course into sex, gender, and sexuality and a great intro into gender studies if that interests you. Getting the basics down made understanding the context of the texts on Persian love poetry and mysticism so much easier to understand. I feel like this course just generally made me a more informed, well-read human being.  Note: you definitely do NOT need to be Persian to take the class. Most people weren't Persian and didn't speak it, it's all in English. It was so cool seeing all types of people enjoy Persian literature. The class was a laid back seminar style where we could freely ask questions when needed, and read through poems that we would then further analyze and tie together with important lecture/reading topics.  WORKLOAD:Really manageable and if you put in effort and show interest, you will get an A.  This class consisted of weekly reports that were ~200 words where you analyzed the texts/made connections to lecture topics. Easy points and great way to master the topics without much stress.Midterm + Final were both essays with broad topics that allowed you to pick what you were interested in from the course materials covered and use the readings to write about pretty much whatever you were intrigued by.  If you're interested in gender studies, human sexuality outside the Western context, poetry from Sufis like Rumi and Hafez, or even just into art and literature as a whole, TAKE THIS CLASS!"
Domenico Ingenito,NA,Gender and Sexuality in Arts and Literatures of Iran and Middle East,IRANIAN 55,A,"This is the first time I am actually writing a review on Bruinwalk because I absolutely LOVED this professor and this class. Professor Ingenito demonstrates such passion for the subject matter and just wants to see his students engage in the subject material and learn, which is further encouraged by the fact that he offers extra credit for simply attending lecture and participating. He wants his students to focus on learning and not stress about grades so he has made an effort to ensure that it is quite difficult to not do well in this class - all you need to do is show up and actually learn and engage with the course material and you will do well. The course material is also so incredibly interesting and a side of history that I never knew existed. I learned so much in this class and I enjoyed every second. Also, Ingenito is just the purest most wholesome professor I've ever had. He gets so excited about the topics we cover and the insight the students offer. Attending lecture each week and seeing his animated face light up in class really made my quarter. If you are looking for an easy, not to mention incredibly interesting GE with a professor who actually cares about his students, TAKE THIS CLASS. You will not regret it."
Domenico Ingenito,NA,Gender and Sexuality in Arts and Literatures of Iran and Middle East,IRANIAN 55,A,"For a first time course, this class was beautifully constructed and planned out. The professor knew exactly what he wanted us to learn from this class and took the time to answer any questions we had. He really allowed his students to have a voice, which is very important. All of the readings connected weekly to what we were learning in class. Also, the syllabus was very straightforward."
Domenico Ingenito,NA,Gender and Sexuality in Arts and Literatures of Iran and Middle East,IRANIAN 55,A,"Ingenito really cares for his students and it shows. He is the sweetest professor ever and if you are looking for an easy GE take this class. I feel like the review above me says it all so I'm not going to repeat much. Both TAs, Atiyeh, and Julie were GOATs. They explaining everything so well and were really nice and chill. 10/10 recommend this class to anyone."
Domenico Ingenito,NA,Gender and Sexuality in Arts and Literatures of Iran and Middle East,IRANIAN 55,A,"I feel like the other reviews were a bit misleading. This class was pretty easy up until the midterm and final. We were given readings every week to complete, but to be honest I never did them and ended up getting an A so that does say something about how easy it is. We also had a weakly report we had to submit every week discussing the readings from that week, but it is pretty easy to make stuff up because it was just completion points. However, the midterm and final were pretty ridiculous. Midterm:The midterm was due Tuesday night of week 7 and he expected us to include ALL of the readings that we had been assigned so far in class to be cited in the paper. (For reference, it was about 25 different sources, some of which had nothing to do with the prompt.) It was supposed to be a minimum of 1,500 words and no more than 1,800. The prompt was extremely broad and hard to have a clear, cohesive argument while also forcing 25 different sources in the paper. I will say that as long as you have a clear thesis, some form of structure, and use all the sources, you should get an A on the paper.Final:Final was the same format, but he only expected us to use sources from week 6 and after. The prompt for the final was really similar to the midterm except he had us also discuss the concept of spirituality. I found the final was easier than the midterm.Final thoughts:I think if gender and sexuality studies interest you, you will love this class. Professor Ingenito was very enthusiastic about the topic and made it easy to enjoy learning in class."
Domenico Ingenito,NA,Gender and Sexuality in Arts and Literatures of Iran and Middle East,IRANIAN 55,A," TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!! I am a first-year student and wanted to take some GEs. I'm a STEM major but I would totally take this class again.  Professor Ingenito: You will never find someone as sweet and as passionate as he is! He truly cares about his students and the way his face lights up is the most wholesome thing ever. All he wants is to share his passion for Persian literature with his students. He doesn't care about grades as long as he knows that you understand the materials. He constantly asks for feedback and is so adaptable to his teaching styles to make sure each of his students is doing well. Workload: Each class he assigns us reading or two for the next lecture and they are so interesting. Most of the time I never read them, I just skimmed through right before class to get a general idea, but almost all of the readings he gave us were something I enjoyed reading. They cover the topics of gender, sex, and love related to Persian poets, their works, and the Iranian government. I basically spent like one hour of work a week on this class. Grades: The only thing you have to do in this class is to upload a weekly report which is around 200-300 words minimum. All you do is write about what you learned within the past week. That's literally it. The midterm and final are short papers (1,500 words) and on both of them, he asks you to just write a paper connecting the readings that were assigned in the quarter. THAT'S IT!!!!!! It shows just how much he truly just wants you to understand the coursework and general ideas in this class. He also gives extra credit for showing up to lectures. TAs: Both of the TAs are awesome and you can't go wrong with picking one.  General Takeaway- For my first quarter at UCLA, this was my favorite class. It was nice having a professor that actually knew my name and genuinely cared about me and how I was doing. I loved that this class wasn't so focused on grades, and in all honestly, that led to me learning more because I simply was engaged with learning rather than focusing on making sure I got a good grade. I learned so much from this course and it truly changed my perspective on lots of things."
Domenico Ingenito,NA,Gender and Sexuality in Arts and Literatures of Iran and Middle East,IRANIAN 55,A+,"Okay so I took this class fall 2022 during the strike so I didn't finish out the year, but I still really enjoyed this class! I really appreciated how Professor Ingenito canceled class in solidarity with our striking TAs, iconic! This was a really fascinating class and I learned so much about medieval and modern Iranian history, art, and poetry through the lens of gender and sexuality! It was clear that Professor Ingenito really cared about this subject, and I had a great time! The workload was really light as well, just do the reading and come to class and you'll be fine! He's a really easy grader too :)"
Domenico Ingenito,NA,Gender and Sexuality in Arts and Literatures of Iran and Middle East,IRANIAN 55,A+,"Content was really interesting, but there was quite a bit of reading. We had weekly reports synthesizing and reflecting on the readings, and we self-reported how many hours we spent on the class (syllabus said he expected 10-15 hours per week including class and discussion, but dedicating that much time is not necessary at all). We had two, 1500-word papers where we had to cite all readings assigned up until the paper (around 20-25 readings, I think). I thought that my TA (Julie) graded pretty leniently. Lectures were not recorded and slides were very long and text-heavy. Prof lectured on specific passages from the readings to talk about fluidity, homoeroticism, mysticism, etc in medieval poetry, but also tended to talk about topics that didn't relate to the readings."
Domenico Ingenito,NA,Gender and Sexuality in Arts and Literatures of Iran and Middle East,IRANIAN 55,A+," As someone who knew nothing about Persian culture coming into the class, Iranian 55 was a really nice introduction. Dr. Ingenito was welcoming towards students of all backgrounds. 40% of your grade was based on coming to class and reading the literature he posted. 30% was your midterm and 30% was your final. The prompts for the midterm and final were broad, but allow you to rope in all the readings and create nuanced arguments. They are pretty easy to answer as long as you pay attention in class. I feel like I learned a lot and had a genuinely good time!"
Domenico Ingenito,NA,Gender and Sexuality in Arts and Literatures of Iran and Middle East,IRANIAN 55,A," As someone who did not come from an Iranian or Middle Eastern background, I thought this class was a nice introduction to Iranian culture. Though there were often times where I felt like an outsider, Professor Ingenito emphasized several times that everyone was welcome in this class. He had interactive lectures where he'd ask students to share their thoughts/ideas as he taught and was always open to answering questions. It was also really nice that we didn't have to buy any textbooks for this class.  Grade distribution: 10% attendance of lectures and discussions (I don't think attendance was ever taken at lectures though) 30% weekly reports (graded on completion & usually just asking us to share thoughts on the weekly assigned readings. The amount of reading was overwhelming at first, but fortunately they decreased a bit toward the end of the quarter. Some did fine by just skimming, but since I was unfamiliar with the subject material, I often had to read very carefully) 30% midterm essay 30% final essay up to 7% extra credit by attending guest lectures via zoom and submitting a ~300 word reflection about it (1% per lecture attended)  About the midterm & final essays - the prompts were very broad but I personally found them pretty tough because we were required to incorporate every single reading we were assigned into them. Even though prof said that they would be graded leniently, the TAs did not really follow through with this. If it wasn't for the way participation and weekly reports were weighted, the grade distribution for this class would be much worse. Tbh my qualms with this class mostly came from my personal experiences during discussions and with my TA (Nora), but I'll leave those out of this review.  Overall, I would recommend this class if you're interested in learning about Iranian culture especially through gender and sexuality. The weighting of assignments means you don't have to do particularly well on the essays to get an A. I learned a lot and the way I view gender has changed."
Domenico Ingenito,NA,Gender and Sexuality in Arts and Literatures of Iran and Middle East,IRANIAN 55,A,"Professor Ingenito is so insightful, knowledgeable and helpful. Class was super manageable, we had a weekly report on the readings due each Monday graded only on completion. These were pretty easy but I HIGHLY suggest you actually put time into them because they are super helpful for your midterm and final which are essays that you have about a week to do. Overall light course load but the material is all really interesting and meaningful. I highly recommend!!!"
Domenico Ingenito,NA,Gender and Sexuality in Arts and Literatures of Iran and Middle East,IRANIAN 55,A+,"If you are looking for a very easy, low-workload GE, take this class. Ingenito is chill, but you will learn most of the content from the readings he assigns (about 2-3 research articles a week and/or website articles and media)."
Domenico Ingenito,NA,Gender and Sexuality in Arts and Literatures of Iran and Middle East,IRANIAN 55,A+,"I think the other reviews have done a great job of explaining the course structure, but wow. This class was so eye-opening and interesting, and I definitely hope that it is taught in the future.  I also hope to take another class with him someday :)"
Domenico Ingenito,NA,Advanced Persian: Introduction to Classical Persian Poetry,IRANIAN 103A,A,"Submit a very simple weekly paragraph, take detailed notes during lectures, connect the poets and their unique writings to one another in your papers, understand the material and you will be fine. Very helpful at office hours and not a tough grader, would recommend for units compared to other classes"
Domenico Ingenito,NA,Advanced Persian: Introduction to Classical Persian Poetry,IRANIAN 103A,A+,"I took Iranian 103A and 103B with Professor Ingenito. He is probably one of the most knowledgeable professors in the department. He is extremely lenient and caring. I really think he deserves better reviews. For lectures, he goes over meaning, grammar of the poems. There are some weekly reports which are really easy. The class consisted of two exams which is translation of poem to English or modern Persian. I recommend taking his class."
Domenico Ingenito,NA,Advanced Persian: Introduction to Classical Persian Poetry,IRANIAN 103A,A+,"I took Dr. Ingenito for Iranian 103A, 103B and 150A. He is one of my favorite professors at UCLA.  I really enjoyed  all the classes I took with him. He is very approachable and  he cares about his students. He is so knowledgable and I learned a lot from  him . I was really surprised when I read the bad reviews about him and decided to write one. Neither of the classes I took with him were hard and the workload wasn’t heavy at all; the grade distribution says it all. Participation and weekly reports had a great percent of the total grade. Mid term and final of Iranian 150 were take home essays about the readings we were supposed to read through the course and he gives guidlines about how to write them. For midterm and final of Iranian 103 series we had to translate poems to English or modern Persian and it was from poems that we had gone over in the class. We didn’t need to buy any text book and he posts all the files we needed. I RECOMMEND HIS  CLASSES TO EVERYONE. Take him and you won’t regret it."
Domenico Ingenito,NA,Advanced Persian: Introduction to Classical Persian Poetry,IRANIAN 103A,A+,"Clearly the person who gave Professor Ingenito a bad review was one of the many people who just talked over him and was not paying attention. This is UCLA don't expect to get an A handed to you by doing nothing.This class on the other hand was not difficult at all and the professor is extremely lenient and kind, he cares about his students and is passionate about what he teaches. He is not picky at all I always submitted just a few sentences for my weekly online posts and I would get full credit because what I wrote showed that I understood what he said in lecture. All you have to do is listen, just like any other class and you will do fine! NOT HARD AT ALL. Just take him if the subject interests you. Professor Ingenito is soo knowledgable and has a great teaching style that is soo easy to understand! He lectures in depth about the poems and goes over the meanings, background, and style of the poet. He really cares about his students learning the material and understanding it as well. The class consisted of two papers and a midterm exam, and one weekly online post about your understanding of the lecture and poems (the online post actually helped me big time when it came time to write my papers) all were graded extremely fair! All you have to do is grasp the basic understanding of the poems if he sees you are trying and you aren't just making things up he will give you credit. He is not a hard grader at all, the subject is very fun if it interests you, and he is pretty funny too!Take his class he is great,  I learned a lot about Persian culture and it was actually a GPA booster for me. If I knew how to read and write in Persian I would take all his classes!"
Domenico Ingenito,NA,Advanced Persian: Introduction to Classical Persian Poetry,IRANIAN 103A,B+,"Ingenito is a great teacher. My brother and I took him during the fall 2018 for an iranian poetry, it was by far the best class I have taken at UCLA. Anyone who says other wise never took a UCLA class, and I question how they got admitted to the school if you can’t  handle his workload. His style of teaching is simple and he always takes his time and does open office hours to you! He’s very chill and and has a good sense of humor. Don’t let the reviews fool you. 11 out of 10"
Domenico Ingenito,NA,Advanced Persian: Introduction to Classical Persian Poetry,IRANIAN 103A,N/A,Professor Ingenito is probably one of the most knowledgable professors in the department that I have encountered. His class is super fun and the workload is not too heavy if you dedicate a little bit of time to go over the poems after each lecture. He knows the answer to all your questions! I absolutely enjoyed taking this course and recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about the world of literature.
Domenico Ingenito,NA,Advanced Persian: Introduction to Classical Persian Poetry,IRANIAN 103A,B,"Professor Ingenito is definitely one of the WORST professors I have taken at UCLA. He has clear favorites in the class and acts as if his students are doing well but gives them terrible grade. Too much work for a class like this. He does not want his students to do well and is not a nice guy. I dreaded going to his class and he was such a rude professor. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. You will think you are doing well and you end up with a B. Students would ask him questions and he would reply back in a sarcastic and rude way. Just don't take this class, I regretted it and it ruined my GPA."
Domenico Ingenito,NA,Advanced Persian: Introduction to Classical Persian Poetry,IRANIAN 103A,B,"I feel like ingenito posted the review below himself because nobody got an A+ in his class.... even people who got A's on everything  got flat A's. He plays clear favorites, is rude when people enagage in class materials and is probably one of the most unhelpful teachers Ive had at ucla. He has a g-d complex for sure and thinks he knows everything about Iranian Poetry. Save your GPA. Not worth it and i didnt learn shit"
Domenico Ingenito,NA,Advanced Persian: Introduction to Classical Persian Poetry,IRANIAN 103A,B+,"Dont let the grading scale fool you. This professor is nuts. He was unclear, unhelpful and his grading is all off. He refuses to discuss your grades with you in person. He claimed half the class did badly on the final and gave half the class B's. He said he was tired of getting the easy teacher reputation so he did something about it last quarter and screwed everybody over. There are weekly assignments 500 words minimum, in class midterm exam, midterm paper 2500 words, final paper 1500 words. His class was the most boring class I have ever taken and everybody is on their laptops the whole time - literally nobody pays attention. His grading is horrible and he is horrible as a person as well. He does not care about his students and will trick you into thinking youre doing good by giving you good grades on the midterms but will then give you a horrible final grade.  DO NOT RECCOMEND!! SAVE YOUR GPA"
Domenico Ingenito,NA,Advanced Persian: Introduction to Classical Persian Prose,IRANIAN 103B,A+,"I took Iranian 103A and 103B with Professor Ingenito. He is probably one of the most knowledgeable professors in the department. He is extremely lenient and caring. He always encourage students to come to his office hours. For lectures, he goes over meaning, grammar of the poems. There are some weekly reports which are easy. The class consisted of two exams which is translation of poem to English or modern Persian and it was from poems that we had gone over in the class. You don't need textbook for this class. I recommend taking his class. He is one of my favorite professor at UCLA."
Salih C Aciksoz,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A,"The class consisted of three papers and participation. The readings were a bit much depending on the week, but if you can find your way around them you should be fine. Discussions just went over the readings. The professor gave us enough time to write the papers and the prompts were pretty interesting."
Salih C Aciksoz,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A,"The class was simple and consisted of three main essays. Ended up with an A but the TA graded my two essays quite harsher compared to other people. Consisted of a media analysis (which was interesting), pandemic diaries (super simple and straightforward, and an ethnography."
Salih C Aciksoz,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A," The grade for this class consists of 3 papers Mini-ethnography (4 pages, 30%)Media Analysis (4 pages, 30%), my personal favoritePandemic Diary (7 pages total, 1 page journal entry everyday for one week, 30%) Participation in discussion (10%)  Overall this class is pretty easy, coming from someone who does not like writing at all. The discussions were based off of weekly readings which were manageable. Some were more boring than others. The lectures were honestly pretty useless. The first few lectures were necessary in understanding what anthropology actually is, but afterwards I would say you did not need any of the information from lecture. The ethnography paper was based on your own observations and analysis at an outside place of choice. The media analysis paper was based on a film that we watched for class and watching another movie that connected to that film. The pandemic diary was pretty open ended, where we wrote about our day while connecting it to the pandemic as well as general concepts of the readings/lectures. While the topics were pretty eye-opening, I did not feel the need/want to sit through lecture due to it being useless in the actual assignments itself."
Salih C Aciksoz,NA,Culture and Society,ANTHRO 3,A,"I really liked Professor Aciksoz. He had engaging lectures with powerpoint slides and the material isn't hard to grasp at all, while also being interesting at the same time. However, your grade in this class is very dependent on your TA, and I got stuck with a TA that graded my midterm and paper (called a ""mini-ethnography"") extremely harshly where friends in other sections got graded very easily. The midterm was not difficult if you pay attention in class, but it is entirely up to your TA as to how nitpicky they want to grade. Overall, this class was interesting and I would take a class again with Aciksoz but just make sure I get a reasonable TA!"
Salih C Aciksoz,NA,Selected Topics in Cultural Anthropology,ANTHRO 139,A,"He is one of the most enthusiastic and passionate professor that I’ve encountered so far in regarding to not only teaching the material but explaining it! The class overall is fairly easy if you attend lecture on a regular basis and go to section! The PowerPoint slides are honestly just for him to reference on what he is saying about that weeks subject and relating it back to readings. He does include YouTube videos and a couple movies in lecture as well (talk about fun!) Although the readings are mandatory and are a lot if you miss any he references them in lecture so you have an idea what’s happening but it’s best to go back and skim/read them! There is 1 mid term with 3 short answers and 1 long essay question. There is a paper that’s due but it’s early on the quarter so you don’t have to worry about it during finals. The final is in similar format to the mid term with 4 short answers and 2 long essay questions. Honestly his teaching style and enthusiasm made me excited to go to his class and I would take him again if I could! One of the best anthro professors out there! I highly recommend! He will rejuvenate your excitement and interest in being an anthro major if you’re in a rut on questioning if this is what you wanna do! If you can take this class and introduce yourself to him, especially with going to office hours he appreciates it and invokes new thought!"
Nile Green,NA,World History to A.D. 600,HIST 20,A+,"I have the class online because of the pandemic. Dr. Green is a fantastic lecturer and wants you to enjoy the materials. The grades however depend on your Ta because your letter grade depends on three essays only. So, if you meet a harsh Ta it will NOT be an easy A. In my case I have Ha as my TA who is fantastic and lenient!"
Nile Green,NA,World History to A.D. 600,HIST 20,A,"This class is graded based on three essays and nothing else. In the syllabus, it states that attendance and participation in discussion sections are mandatory, but they are not included in the grade composition, so I am unsure how it is enforced. Participation in discussions is probably important to get to know your TAs, though, who determine your entire grade. Lectures, which are podcasts recorded by the professor, are not required and are not needed to get a good grade from my experience. I personally did not have this issue, but because the grade is entirely based upon the grading difficulty of the TA's, you have to kind of get lucky with which TA you get to get a good grade. The class workload is very light, which is nice, but no extra credit or grade fluffing assignments are offered so you have to be a good essay writer to get a good grade in this class."
Nile Green,NA,World History to A.D. 600,HIST 20,A," Disclaimer: this was during COVID-19. I came into this class expecting it to have a heavily workload, but it honestly was pretty light. There was no “busy work” nor tests in the class – our entire grade was determined by three essays. On top of that, we had to watch podcasted lectures, read the textbook, and read primary source documents every week. Discussion sections were mandatory, but if you have a good TA these are extremely helpful for midterm essay preparation. The lectures were very engaging. Each 80-minute-podcast was accompanied by a PowerPoint filled with visual aids. Honestly, I didn’t read the textbook because the lectures and supplemental readings covered most of the material. Definitely read the primary sources though because your essay grades were predicated on your understanding and explication of these materials. The midterm essays (4-pages double spaced) required us to select a visual source (essay 1) or textual source (essay 2) from a select time-frame and write about their historical contexts and speculate about their purposes. The final essay asked us to synthetise textual and visual material to discuss religion in an 8-page paper. Don’t panic though, my TA was very lenient in grading the papers – far easier than say an APUSH essay in high school."
Nile Green,NA,World History to A.D. 600,HIST 20,A,"I will be fully honest, I did not go to lecture past Week 2, and was fully prepared for the midterm & final just by reviewing the lecture slides on my own, attending discussion, and doing the readings. This class is NOT work-heavy at all, very short discussion once a week, I just wasn't super interested in the content. Nile Green is amazing though. He's a great professor and a very likable guy, so you might want to attend lecture just for those reasons. Would definitely take as a History lower-div or GE again."
Nile Green,NA,World History to A.D. 600,HIST 20,A-,Grade is composed of 2 papers and discussion section participation
Nile Green,NA,World History to A.D. 600,HIST 20,A-," This class only had 2 assignments: the midterm (40%) and the final (50%) and the remaining 10% is from discussion participation. I think this class really depends on your TA. Since the midterm is worth so much, if you don't get a good grade on it, the final becomes a lot more stressful. My TA was really strict and I felt like the guidelines for the paper were pretty vague, which wasn't too great as everything is graded by the TA.  Due to the TA strike, we weren't even able to get access to our midterm grades so I had to reach out via email and ask, and this was around Week 8/9 which was a first for me at UCLA. Participation also matters in section so be sure to read the reading assignments before attending. I didn't really go to lecture because the professor doesn't allow you to take notes during his class which I found to be a waste of my time so I instead would always make time to review the lecture slides and take notes on things I found important. In general, taking this class kind of felt like a gamble because there was so little information to base my projected grade on. It's definitely one of the easier GE's but I really didn't like how there were only 2 assignments worth so much, so I would generally advise you to find either an easier GE or switch to a discussion with a chill TA."
Nile Green,NA,World History to A.D. 600,HIST 20,A+,easy GE class. All we had us one midterm paper and one final paper and then discussion section once a week that was mandatory. I rarely went to class and did well in the class. If you want an easy history GE this is a good one. Teacher is super passionate too.
Nile Green,NA,World History to A.D. 600,HIST 20,A-," I took this class in the fall when it was asynchronous. I would definitely NOT recommend taking this class if you need an easy A. The class is easy in that it takes almost no work to complete. You literally just have to write 3 papers. The 3 papers count for your entire grade though, and it definitely didn't seem like the professor and TA were on the same page about what the paper was supposed to be about. The instructions for the papers were just one or two questions that you had to base an entire 4-8 page paper on. My TA definitely had no idea what was going on in the class or how to grade the papers. There was no rubric, and she didn't know what the heck she was talking about in discussion. I got an 86% on my first paper (which was 25% of the overall grade) and I asked the TA what I did wrong, and she cited things that she told me to do, such as putting ""/"" between quotations. I emailed the professor and he said there was nothing he could do about the grade and that he and the TAs thoroughly talked over how to grade the papers.  It definitely didn't seem like it because the TA was telling us to write a different prompt than was given by the professor.  Overall, the workload is easy. Just read whatever you want to write your paper on, and write 3 papers over the quarter. But be warned, the grading is whack, so you better get a good TA."
Nile Green,NA,World History to A.D. 600,HIST 20,A+," This class is naturally asynchronous, as all lectures take the form of prerecorded podcasts. Your entire grade consists of three essays—4 pages on an ancient artifact, 4 pages on an ancient primary source document, and an 8 page synthesis on ancient religion—with no homework, projects, exams, or anything else. The weekly workload consisted of two hour-long lecture podcasts, about four supplementary documents, one chapter of the textbook, and one discussion section. Conceivably all one has to do to get an A is read all the supplementary documents relevant to your essay topics and listen to the one lecture podcast associated with it—you can honestly get by without listening to most lectures and completely ignoring the textbook, though I wouldn't recommend doing this as it creates bad habits. The workload as described above is very, very light, and if you're an able writer with any remote interest in ancient history or religion in general, this is the GE for you. I've heard that some TA's for this course are rather harsh and nit-picky graders though; I had Cristi Whiskey as my TA and I thought she was very fair and accommodating, I would definitely recommend her."
Nile Green,NA,World History to A.D. 600,HIST 20,B+,"This class was not bad but my TA definitely made it more difficult than necessary. Basically, your grade depends on two papers and a final paper. So, there's not a lot of room for messing up even tho you might be on top of readings and participate a lot in class. I did learn a lot in this class but I wish I was graded easier on the papers."
Nile Green,NA,World History to A.D. 600,HIST 20,A,"I took this class during Covid-19 and it was relatively easy. Professor Green is awesome and the content is super interesting. This class is conducted asynchronously and there isn't weekly graded homework. The only thing thats iffy is the grading, which is based entirely on 3 essays. They are interesting to write and as long as you just read that section then you should be fine. Its great if you want a class where you simply do all the work on your own time."
Nile Green,NA,World History to A.D. 600,HIST 20,A+," Great professor. All lectures were audio recordings (podcast-like). Supporting slides and lectures together were informative and taught me a lot about the course. The course material itself is quite interesting and relates the history of many places. You begin to realize the global roots of many cultures and the surprising influences of other cultures on yours. Overall, a fun and exciting class. There were 3 papers in total (25% + 25% + 50%) and were not that difficult. You had to analyze some ancient object or script. TAs are amazing and discussions were fun so participate if you can! Shoutout to Madeline Grimm for being a great TA."
Nile Green,NA,Iran and Persianate World,HIST 102A,A,"There is literally just an in class midterm and a take home paper final. That is all. So, workload is obviously manageable but there is a LOT of content to be covered in this class. The lectures aren't technically mandatory (he doesn't take attendance) but he does not post the lecture slides on BruinLearn, in an attempt to encourage students to come to class. Green is so knowledgeable on the subject that it may sometimes become overwhelming-- a lot of his lectures are often so packed with information that I would definitely recommend doing the weekly readings so that you know what's going on. There isn't a lot of background information provided, he kind of throws you into all of the content because he is so familiar with it, so you are going to need to be proactive and learn on your own if you want to do well. That being said, very straight forward midterm and final. If you put in the time and work, you will get an A."
Nile Green,NA,Iran and Persianate World,HIST 102A,A,"I could really go on and on about how amazing this class was. The workload was perfect, the lectures were unbelievably, astoundingly good (seriously Prof. Green has some talent to give lectures that good during COVID), and the grading was more than fair. For online, it was all asynchronous, and while I ordinarily don't like the format, it fit this class really well because the workload was forgiving. You were graded on one 8-page midterm (50%) and one 8-page final (50%). It may sound daunting, but if you speak with him during his office hours, it'll help a ton. Spend a good amount of time outlining it to really nail the organization/thesis and the rest will flow naturally, because the course materials complement the prompt so well. The sources came entirely from the weekly readings which never ever exceeded more than 75 pages per week. There was never a boring reading and this has actually inspired me to take more classes on Iran offered in the history department. Insofar as the material, it explored the expansion of the Persian language and culture from 900AD to 2000AD and I thought it was a really interesting intersection of linguistics and imperial dominance/conquest. If I could take this class every quarter I would."
Nile Green,NA,Iran and Persianate World,HIST 102A,A,"Grading: Midterm is in class essay. Final is take home paper. You get the questions for both on the first day of class. Keep in mind, the final paper is 10 pages (double space). The midterm isn't difficult per se, but if you are like me and have terrible memory make sure you make a timeline/outline essay that you can memorize and then dump on exam day. Got an A in the class, and Prof. Green is great! I was very surprised to see a British professor speaking and reading Farsi and Arabic like it was nothing! Lectures can be kind of long, but if you like architecture, history, and art you will enjoy them. Make sure you do the readings and annotate a few things as it will help for your final paper."
Nile Green,NA,"Indo-Islamic Interactions, 1750 to 1950",HIST M174E,N/A,"Lectures can be boring and redundant, but Professor is extremely nice and willing to answer in depth questions.  Only take if you're actually interested in topic."
Nile Green,NA,"Indo-Islamic Interactions, 1750 to 1950",HIST M174E,A-," Professor Green is a really engaging professor who really wants his students to do well. For this class the grade was made up of 50% midterm, 50% final, but he took attendance every class.  For the midterm, the thursday before he gave us the midterm question prompts- and told us we we would get to choose two questions for the midterm. He doesn't surprise you at all, he just really wants you to prepare your answers beforehand. I didn't put that much effort into the preparation and only got a B- on this.  For the final, he gives you the prompt in week 1 of the quarter, and it's a 10 page paper due in Finals week covering the theme of the whole course. I wrote this paper in 24 hours before it was due, and received an A- in the class. He really wants to make sure you show that you've done the reading for this class, so as long as you incorporate at least 1 or two readings from each week into your paper you should be fine. Professor Nile was a great professor and interesting lecturer. Definitely recommend this class!"
Nile Green,NA,Cultural and Political History of Contemporary South Asia,HIST 175A,N/A," Actual Course Taken: 2010 Winter - HIST175C-1Special Topics in Contemporary Indian History: Muslim Reformation? Islam, Modernity, and Empire in British India. Structure: Midterm: 50% , Final: 50%  Midterm: You get to pick one question from weeks 1-5. He provides 5 questions or so and you need to answer one. His syllabus is all online with all online readings organized week by week in themes. He gives a week's advance for a 5-10 page paper. I left it till last minute (Same as I did in the other class) and received a B+ Final: He gave us one ""theme"" question everyone had to do and then a question chosen from 3 possibilities. He gave the questions 5 days in advance and it was on the spot bluebook. I received a B+ Overall, he is a good lecturer, he is interesting but there are NO slides or no overarching textbook to refer to. The readings every week are helpful and you don't need to read every one(Just the weeks you choose to write about). That is good because there were some weeks (Like the Christian missionaries in British India) that did not interest me. I've taken him twice, each time got a B but I would take him again. It does not demand much of you, and if you're into the subject take it! Even if you're not interested in the subject his passion and English accent will make you into it."
Nile Green,NA,Religions of South and Southeast Asia,HIST 185B,N/A," You need to take one of his classes, bottom line. Professor Green is an incredible lecturer, and this is coming from someone who DREADS going to class. But, his lectures are very well organized, easy to understand, and he himself is such a chill person. I loved 185B so much that I decided to take a seminar (191N) with him too. While he does want you to do the reading, you don't have to. But DO go to all of his lectures, pay attention, and write everything that he does on the board. Also, he gives you the essay questions for the midterm and final in advance. This allows you to make a clear and structured essay, memorize your outline, and deliver on the day of the test. Awesome, awesome guy, and both classes were really great. "
Nile Green,NA,Religions of South and Southeast Asia,HIST 185B,N/A,"I agree with the person above me. He is a very approachable guy, good lecturer, and very open to questions or comments. I had no interest in the topic matter prior to the class, I joined the day of when my other class got canceled, and ended up really enjoying the class. He is a mildly hard grader, I got an A- on the midterm after putting a decent amount of effort into it. Saw a few Cs from other people. Lecture material and online readings cover everything. Books aren't really needed. No surprises on the final (which I am about to take)saves a lot of headache. Overall I would highly recommend him. I plan to take his 175 class next quarter (assuming I get a good grade in this class! :D)"
Nile Green,NA,Religions of South and Southeast Asia,HIST 185B,N/A,"Prof Green is very charming and well-spoken. The lecture: Some key dates, places and people hand written on the chalkboard then he lectures for the rest of the class. Most of the class is his verbal lecturing so if you are not there to take down verbatim what he says-it'll get confusing to borrow notes from someone who just wrote a few dates that he wrote on the board. There are no slides or lectures posted online but he assigns weekly readings that include primary sources. You don't HAVE to read them but if you go through them the class makes so much more sense so if you skip a day you won't be totally confused. His midterm was a take home paper. He provided 2 questions from each of the weeks 1-5 and we had to choose one and write a paper on it using that weeks primary sources, readings and lectures. I did not try my hardest on it and was a little scatterbrained and I got a B. He writes e-mails back very fast and I've been to his office hrs once and he seemed approachable. He can come off a tad intimidating but you can tell he just wants students to learn. I am in week 9 but the final is the same format of the midterm except it is in class. He is going to give us a week in advance to look and study the question so on final day we come in and write the essay on the spot. Overall, he is a good prof and very passionate and colorful in his teaching style. He is also very open-minded and provides all different historical views! Good prof, take him if the actual subject matter is of slight interest to you. So if you can handle a class that has no online post of lectures-no slides, only a midterm/final essay style but with a good prof relaying it to you-then take it!"
Katherine Coffing,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,A,"Unless this class is asynchronous, don't take it. The lectures are not engaging, the exams were sometimes difficult, and I just did not enjoy this at all. Would only take again if it was asynchronous, and to get a science GE out of the way."
Katherine Coffing,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"coffing isn't as bad as everyone says. she's not that hard, and the tests aren't that hard, though there is a lot of material to cover in that class. the book isn't that bad, and wisdom of the bones is an interesting read. i liked that book. people need to stop griping and grow up. this is college!"
Katherine Coffing,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A," Coffing was very mediocre. The Wisdom of the Bones was on the final, but never once even mentioned in class, in the practice final, or even mentioned in section. And it seemed like that book was on the syllabus just to sell and plug her friend/associate's work. The class also is just way too big. TA Siamak was amazing though. Very knowledgeable, very helpful, and very personable too. Definitely recommended--he knows his stuff."
Katherine Coffing,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A," I didn't like Prof Coffing. I guess I wasn't that fair from the start with her because I was already biased. I have had bad experiences with female profs. All female profs that I've had have been overly enthusiastic with their material, which is annoying (for me), and made jokes that were so corny that I was actually embarassed for them. Prof Coffing is no exception. She seems to enjoy showing us slides of hominoid genitalia and sexual behavior. And she always makes a joke about them. Anyways, this course isn't hard really. But there's SO much material covered during the course. And, the test questions seem so easy because they are so general, but the answers they want are so specific, it's hard to know what they are really asking for. It's so frustrating because you finish the test thinking you did well because you knew everything they asked but you get a bad grade because they asked a vague question and was looking for a specific answer. I wouldn't say that this is a good class or a bad class, but a BORING one and don't take it if you are just looking for a GE class, there are much better ones out there."
Katherine Coffing,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"If you're looking for an easy GE class: DON'T TAKE ANTHRO 7 WITH COFFING!  If you're looking to fullfill a major requirment: WAIT FOR ANOTHER PROFESSOR TO TEACH THE COURSE!! If you're just interesting in learning about Human Evolution: COFFING WILL KILL IT! Professor Coffing has to be the most lifeless, uninteresting, monotonous person @UCLA. She provides no insight in lecture; instead she regurgitats (word-for-word) what is already in the book. Her exams are not entirely hard but they are vague especially when you don't know what she wants for a ""correct"" answer since she holds no review before the midterm or final.  I just wish there would have been reviews for her before I took her class so that I could have stayed as far as possible from her ""teaching""."
Katherine Coffing,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,"First let me just say that I got an A- on the midterm, i have gone to every class and done all the readings ahead of time.  That said, professor coffing is the second worst prof. that i have had at ucla.  When she is lecturing, it sounds like she is trying to be quiet because she is at the library.  Her voice is so low and monotonous that i just about fall asleep everyday in the front row.  The only reason that I did well on the midterm was because a lot of the material was the same as LS 15.  I really feel sorry for those students that did not know the material ahead of time.  She rushes so quickly through the important material that you do not have enough time to take good notes.  If it weren't for Lecture Notes from Ackerman, I would be lost.  She really makes no attempt to make the material interesting and she seems like she lacks a personality.  I'm sure that she is a very smart person and she might be well trained in her field but she is not a great professor.  You would be better off taking this course when it is taught by a different professor; just wait the extra quarter or whatever it takes."
Katherine Coffing,NA,Human Evolution,ANTHRO 1,N/A,She's really boring.. I feel asleep in every lecture.  The class I took and essay midterms and finals that were graded really hard.  The TAs are not help and very little prep. is giving before tests.  I really  don't suggest you take this class if you need to fulfill a GE
Katherine Coffing,NA,Survey of Biological Anthropology,ANTHRO 120,N/A,"Like the previous review, I find her to be the 2nd worse prof I have had at UCLA. This class is billed as a lecture, however, she calls it a discussion class. There was absolutely no meaningful discussion whatsoever the whole quarter. We had an 800 page reader with reading assignments for each class. The readings were very interesting, however, they were very redundant. The whole quarter consisted of reading for the day and then coming into class and reiterating what we read. When a student would question the readings she would basically ignore it. When she chimed in with her views she was very dry, boring, and monotone. Stay away from any class she teaches."
Katherine Coffing,NA,Australopithecines,ANTHRO 121B,N/A,"This class could have been incredibly boring as, though I love Anthropology, australopithicines can be very dry.  But it WASN'T!  Dr. Coffing is a great professor.  She's engaging, aware of the curent developments in the field, and encourages you to think for yourself.  The midterm and final come almost entirely from the questions the students submit, so you have a very fair idea of what to know.  She's very dedicated and interested in making you interested in the subject.  I can't wait to take another class with her."
Katherine Coffing,NA,Reconstructing Hominid Behavior and Paleoecology,ANTHRO 121P,N/A,"Professor Coffing led this seminar of about 16 students very well. Although there was a lot of reading involved, we would critically discuss each of the topics. ""Critical discussion"" may not be the appropriate description...it was more like ripping up some of the theories and laying down the truth.  Coffing has made me more aware of my ability to be skeptical, which sadly seems like a new concept in a university setting where we are almost always expected to simply regurgitate others' opinions. Take this class if you want to be challenged and to challenge the work of other anthropologists."
Janet Goodwin,NA,Second/Foreign Language Teaching Practicum,APPLING C118B,N/A,"Janet is an awesome teacher, I would defiantly recommend taking a class with her if the opportunity presents itself."
John H Schumann,NA,Nature of Learning,APPLING 102W,N/A,"Professor Schumann is very engaging and always loves to get his students involved with the material he is teaching. Because this class is about second language acquisition it is really easy to relate with the students. As for the class, lectures are pretty easy to understand and it's really not difficult. I took APPLING C155, which Schumann teaches, 2 quarters before taking this class (APPLING 102W) so I already knew everything he was lecturing on. He teaches the exact same things as C155 and uses pretty much all of the same handouts except that this class is about writing on your experience and integrating what you learned into your writing. Despite Professor Schumann being an easy professor, the grading is based on your TA. My TA graded more fairly compared to the other TA's but he did not help with improving my revisions. His comments were vague and were not detailed. I received more comments from the peer reviews than my TA. On almost all my final drafts I received no comments although he . Even when I made the changes, and more, to what he pointed out, my essay grade did not change or it only went up 1% on the final draft. There are 3 essays total (each essay requires a rough draft and a final draft) and the grading is:10% rough drafts, 20% final drafts, 10% participation (attendance, participating in section, peer reviews). Also, attendance is taken in class and in section so be sure to go! The TA's change it up by either passing around the sign in sheet at the beginning of class, halfway through, or near the end of class. Because people started leaving class during the break the TA's would check off the names on the sign in sheet to only give credit to those that stay until the end. Overall, the material was relatively easy but the grading depended on your TA. I received an A- at the end of the quarter. I recommend taking both APPLING 102W and C155 (Ling 20 prerequisite)."
John H Schumann,NA,Foundations of Language Acquisition,APPLING C155,N/A,"Professor Schumann was very enthusiastic about what he taught, especially when it was about neurobiology. He always made jokes to keep the class interesting and had a dry sense of humor. Also, his outfits each day were very interesting! Now, about the class itself, he tends to like his classes in the evening so they do seem to drag since it is 2 hours long but he gives a 10-15min break. Sometimes I was lost with what he was talking about since he would bring in all these examples or stories that related to the material and the either continue what he was saying or not finish. I took notes every class, but they weren't very vigorous of detailed notes. And, there are no required books to buy but an optional one (and it is really unnecessary to buy it). The class consisted of 3 exams (mainly fill in the blank or listing things) and it only took about 30min-1hour to finish. We also had to submit our own 5 test questions with the answers before each exam. He would go over all the questions in the classes before the exam and literally make the exam out of the questions we submitted (but not exactly word for word) with maybe a few of his own questions. So basically if you study the test questions everyone submitted you will know about 95% of the answers. The exams were therefore easy and getting an A in the class is not a hard thing to do at all. Despite the ease of this class, I still took away a lot of information about second language learning and the course material. Definitely consider this class whether or not you are an Applied Linguistics major (although there is a Ling 20 prerequisite)! "
John H Schumann,NA,Foundations of Language Acquisition,APPLING 155,A,It's easy to get an A and the professor is really nice!
Christine Holten,NA,Approaches to University Writing,ENGCOMP 2,N/A,Best english teacher I've ever had!
Christine Holten,NA,Approaches to University Writing,ENGCOMP 2I,N/A,"Well, let me put it this way, I hate writing straight up. But taking the class with Professor Holten gives me a lot of pleasure. She cares about this students a lot, and likes to interact with students. It's just fun to talk her."
Christine Holten,NA,Approaches to University Writing,ENGCOMP 2I,N/A,"Really great class! Professor Holten is extremely nice and willing to help. The class material is very interesting composing mainly of article (which are all in her course reader). Assignments: Final portfolio submit 2 out of 3 essay worth 60%,the rest is based on journals, reflection, attendance and the first draft of the 3 essays."
Christine Holten,NA,Approaches to University Writing,ENGCOMP 2I,N/A,She is such a nice and interesting lady. She cares about your writing and is really patient to help you improve. I really put a lot effort in all my three drafts and got an A in the end.She makes people comfortable to ask questions.Fight for her and you will not regret.
Christine Holten,NA,Approaches to University Writing,ENGCOMP 2I,N/A,I love this lady. She is the best teacher i have ever had. take her please! you will not regret it
Christine Holten,NA,Approaches to University Writing,ENGCOMP 2I,N/A,Amazing professor. She really cares about your writing and getting to know you personally. I really learned how to write from her and she never made me feel pressured whenever I needed to speak up in class. I love Holten! ^_^
Christine Holten,NA,"English Composition, Rhetoric, and Language",ENGCOMP 3H,N/A,Very nice teacher. Had her for Eng Comp 3. She reads your drafts and really helps you by writing critiques. Makes it easy to understand how to get a good grade on the papers! 
Christine Holten,NA,"Language, Culture, and Discourse",ENGCOMP 6W,N/A,"Professor Holten is everything, and more! Honestly, any professor that takes the time out to meet with their students INDIVIDUALLY outside of the classroom deserves to be put on a pedestal. Professor Holten doesn't simply lecture and regurgitate useless information, but she ACTUALLY teaches her students and genuinely cares for each of their well beings. She is extremely down to earth amongst a sea of uptight lecturers, which shows how she truly cares about teaching and developing her students. I took 6W after haven taken another Writing II course earlier, and can definitely say I don't regret that decision. The class is extremely organized and structured, making it near impossible to not succeed. The only negative of this class would have to be the 8 am meeting time for all us sleepy students. I can't stress enough how good of a course this was, and urge other students to take this course if you want to not only learn something, but have fun while you're doing it. "
Christine Holten,NA,Academic Writing in the Disciplines: Fine Arts,ENGCOMP 129D,N/A,She is super helpful and very nice!!
Christine Holten,NA,Research in Applied Linguistics,APPLING 200,N/A,"Simply put, the best english teacher I have ever had in my entire life. The conferences are really effective because each student gets 30 minutes of 1:1 meeting to get feedbacks on how to improve my paper. Your grade is guaranteed if you simply listen to her directions carefully and follow it. I'm not hesitant to keep in touch with her later on because she's such a nice person and very caring."
Hongyin Tao,NA,Advanced Modern Chinese,CHIN 100A,N/A," organized but BORING class, lecture wasn't that helpful but attendance is mandatory so... ugh.  But usually you ain't got much of a choice in taking any chinese classes since there's only one teaching anyways...  Not too much homework."
Hongyin Tao,NA,Introduction to Chinese Linguistics,CHIN 120,N/A," Even though Professor Tao is very esteemed and is head of the Chinese department, his class is unexpectedly very manageable and fun. His powerpoints are well-organized and easy to understand. Professor Tao also includes a lot of interesting videos that go along with his lectures. Midterm and final are also very easy. There is one presentation at the end of the quarter, but he and Daisy (Su Laoshi) are nice graders. Pop quizzes are easy and open-note and open-book. I came out of the class feeling like I learned a lot about Chinese linguistics. His class proves that you don't have to give a lot of work to students for them to learn something. "
Hongyin Tao,NA,Introduction to Chinese Linguistics,CHIN 120,N/A,"Like others say that lectures are organized but very very boring. This class is easy but you have to watch out one thing that is get all your participation grade and presentation grade as soon as possible. Many people think that they can get good grade on participation and presentation, so they concentrate on homework and exams only but these two grades can really affect your total grade. Especially your presentation grade, if you don't ask him, you will never know. Discuss the presentation topic with him, ohterwise he may say your topic is too old or out of range, etc. and you will get a lots of points deduction because of this."
Daria Bahtina,NA,Language and Identity,LING M7,A+,"Professor Daria is extremely helpful and caring for her students. For each lecture, she provides detailed notes and great lecture slides, and the assigned reading that comes along with each lecture is also very interesting. She makes the concept easily digestible by using relatable examples and she answers any questions carefully to avoid any confusions student might have. The final project is also very interesting, although it is a group project, professor Daria gives a lot of time in discussions to allow students to work on them and constantly provide guidance on the project. Professor Daria is also approachable outside of class, she makes her schedule flexible according to students' needs. One time before the finals, the professor arranged a  meet-up with me outside of her regular office hours and went through my questions one by one thoroughly until I understood, and I was really touched by her. I highly recommend taking this class with her!"
Daria Bahtina,NA,Language and Identity,LING M7,A," This class was my first GE and I am so thankful that I enrolled in it. The professor is genuinely passionate and her material is very interesting.- The material can be confusing, so I highly recommend attending office hours and the discussion. That being said I wasn't very diligent about attending discussions and I was still able to understand and do well in the class. - Read your materials before hand and attend class, there's a quiz almost every lecture- The professor gives extra credit for participating in the psychology department's experiments, using the writing center, and going to the library. If I took it again I would NOT MISS A CLASS! Professor Bahtina is very helpful, knowledgeable and engaging"
Daria Bahtina,NA,Language and Gender: Introduction to Gender and Stereotypes,LING 40W,A+,"Dr. Bahtina is extremely caring and thoughtful. She tried her best to make the class engaging - even during COVID - and I appreciate her a bunch! The class wasn't too challenging, but the research paper was definitely more intense than I was expecting. Definitely give your topic some thought, because I ended up hating my topic by the end of the quarter. Daria is super approachable and sweet, but the readings were definitely quite dense. Don't let that dissuade you too much though - I overall enjoyed the class."
Daria Bahtina,NA,Language and Gender: Introduction to Gender and Stereotypes,LING 40W,A,"I took this course just because this was the only writing 2 course available that granted social analysis GE credit. Daria is a good lecturer who truly cares about her students learning. Concise lectures and acceptable workload, with participation points for each discussion you attend. I was generally uninterested in the course material though and it made the lectures and activities really boring for me. Also, there is a 3500word research paper you have to write as a final project and it requires a sizeable data collection if you are to do well. I think I've watched almost a hundred YouTube videos to collect linguistic examples I needed to support my paper. All in all, easy A and interesting course material if you are into linguistics and gender stuff. If you aren't it's still acceptable workload and fair grading, though it may be boring af. Recommended."
Daria Bahtina,NA,Language and Gender: Introduction to Gender and Stereotypes,LING 40W,A-,"I loved this class and a huge reason why was because of Daria. She made lectures interesting and engaging. The topic was interesting to me so I had a lot of fun learning about it. The workload isn't crazy, it's a decent amount but the grades given out were all reasonable. Daria wants all of her students to succeed so she is pretty lenient about a lot of things as long as you approach her. She loves when people give their opinion and participate in class. She only grades participation on if you show up to class or not. There are no tests, only one final research paper along with other supplemental writing assignments. I loved this class and would definitely recommend it!"
Daria Bahtina,NA,Language and Gender: Introduction to Gender and Stereotypes,LING 40W,A+," Can't find the review page for her Ling M7, I'll just write it here: I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS CLASS TO ANYONE, THIS CLASS HONESTLY GAVE ME SO MUCH PAIN AND ANXIETY. Most people taking this class are just trying to fulfill their GE req, but Prof Bahtina thinks everyone is linguistics genius or sth, so she made the material really challenging for us. If it wasn't for the curve, I probably would have got a B+, but just because the entire class was doing so poorly, I got round up to an A+ ...? This class killed my interest for linguistics lol"
Daria Bahtina,NA,Introduction to Language Learning and Language Teaching,APPLING 101W,A+," I enrolled this class mostly because it was a GE and WII, and by gosh is it difficult to get into. That being said, I'm really glad I took this class with Dr. Bahtina because I've learned more than I would ever think about learning and teaching language. Dr. Bahtina tries really hard to make sure we are learning practical things, and so this class is really helpful if you want to teach language either in the short or long term. That being said, I wouldn't classify this class as an easy A. Your grade depends on 3 total writing assignments (split up into drafts, so technically 6), weekly journal assignments, peer reviews, a classroom observation (basically just attend a language class and take notes), and participation (+ you get 1% extra credit for using the UWC). The first two writing assignments make up 15% of your grade each, with the final paper being 25%. You can basically get 100% on the peer reviews, journal assignments, and in participation as long as you try to speak in class a couple of times each session. As someone who usually is uncomfortable with speaking in class, I felt like Dr. Bahtina made the environment extremely conducive to participation for students, and I had a really great time in this class. While the content itself isn't insanely hard, there is a fair bit of work associated with the class. But, as long as you stay diligent and go into office hours and utilize feedback from your rough drafts, you should still end up with a good grade."
Daria Bahtina,NA,Bilingualism and Second Language Acquisition,LING C140,A,"Dr. Bahtina is an awesome professor who really knows her craft. The lectures and readings are pretty dense with information and can feel a bit overwhelming. With that said, Dr. Bahtina is there for her students all the time and provides a lot of recourse for any issues that may arise while learning. The group projects are probably the toughest part of the class because they entail the most work and communication among your peers more than any other element of the class. If you attend class, do what is required, and engage in the material, you'll do well. We're lucky to have her here at UCLA."
Daria Bahtina,NA,Fundamentals of Translation and Interpreting,LING 144,A+,"Like other post said, you should take this class when you are confident in many aspects of 2 or 3 languages. Since this quarter is fully online, the prof. has tried to post the slides as well as the Zoom recording on CCLE. There is no test in this class. Just 2 big papers, 5 small homework, 2 group works, ... The grading is ok as long as you follow the guidelines. She is really helpful outside class, responded to emails on time, so remember to reach out to her. The deadlines for some assignments sometimes drove me crazy. For example: the hw posted on Weds, and due on Fri the same week."
Daria Bahtina,NA,Fundamentals of Translation and Interpreting,LING 144,A,"DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU AREN'T VERY FLUENT IN A LANGUAGE!!! I really loved having Professor Daria. She not only was super sweet but also a great professor. It is a lot of busy work, but it's super simple. Considering the situation of this quarter, she made it super enjoyable and I would definitely recommend taking a class with her. There were weekly assignments that didn't take long, an essay where you had to analyze a text that was translated from one language into english, another essay where you had to analyze subtitles in a language translated into english and a big group project where you have to interview people. It was a lot of busy work, but it wasn't hard. I recommend taking this class only if you are fluent in a language because it requires a lot of analyzing. Overall great class and not super hard.  I totally recommend it as an elective for Ling majors and also having her as a professor!"
Daria Bahtina,NA,Language and Society: Introduction to Sociolinguistics,LING 170,A,"I absolutely loved taking 170 with Daria and Corinna as my TA!! They were both so accommodating and helpful, and really took student's opinions into account. Daria is so sweet and funny and played us a song at the beginning of every lecture. Due to the TA strike I didn't get to spend the whole quarter with Corinna but she was an amazing and helpful instructor leading up to the strike. The course is centered around one group project where you study a sociolinguistic phenomenon of your choice and it was a lot of fun. I loved this class and plan on taking bilingualism with Daria in the future!"
Daria Bahtina,NA,Language and Society: Introduction to Sociolinguistics,LING 170,A,"The material for this class is very interesting, and Professor Bahtina makes it very approachable. She's very friendly and approachable, and I'll definitely be taking more courses with her in the future. This class is mostly based on homework assignments and a group project, none of which I found too difficult, nor were they graded particularly harshly. Keep in mind that participation and attendance are graded. I would recommend taking this class, the information is something I that I feel everyone should know, and Professor Bahtina was great."
Daria Bahtina,NA,Language and Society: Introduction to Sociolinguistics,LING 170,A-,"I have taken both 170 and c140(bilingualism and second language acquisition) with professor Bahtina and I am truly amazed how good she is. First of all you can approach to her with any issues, she is caring and understanding on another level. Second, she makes her classroom environment super friendly where shy people like me feel very comfortable. This honestly is hard to do with bunch of students but she does. Her class is very organised and structured. She created this really helpful excel sheet that has all the importance dates that helps to keep track of everything. Overall i never felt overwhelmed with the material in class bc everything is nicely organized . On top of that she reaches back fast if you contact her through slack or email. Okay now about how hard her class is. Considering that both classes are upper div and you are expecting to have knowledge on those topics her class is very doable. She doesn’t have any exams which makes the lectures less stressful and for me it was like watching a very interesting movie. Her lectures are interesting and engaging but because of the length of the class (around 2 hours and no break) it was hard to focus for the entirety of the class. But if you do pay attention in class and do the assignments and ask for her help when something is unclear you will be fine. The group project is time consuming so start early. It is not an easy project you have to choose a topic you are interested and conduct a research about it. So start doing literature review early and look though instructions, don’t wait until she tells everyone to start working on the project bc then it will be a little stressful. Overall if someone is enjoying a more humanistic studies rather then pure linguistics then this class is for you!"
Daria Bahtina,NA,Language and Society,LING 170,A," Most of the final grade depended on the group project, which wasn't too bad to do.  It was broken down into a research proposal, presentation, and final blog article. Every other week a different part of the project was due so by finals week there wasn't much to do but put it all together. So in that sense, Bahtina's assignments helped with overall time-management so you wouldn't procrastinate and be super stressed out near finals.  But other parts of the class were less organized. There was a quiz on the assigned reading for every class, and they were pretty difficult. Since they were out of 3 questions, you either passed or failed. But after you're done with the quiz, you could basically leave the class because she just goes in depth about the reading you just took the quiz for. I mean, she was really funny and what she talked about was always interesting and relevant, but you didn't really need to be there anymore since the group project and other assignments were done outside of class.  The class was pretty lax besides the quizzes. But since everyone in class did so poorly on them, she bumped everyone's overall quiz grade by like 21% so there were a lot of 100%. There was also 5% of extra credit you could do which was really easy. So I think in the end, nearly everyone got like A's and A+'s.  Anyways, Bahtina is really nice and easy to approach. She's young and makes a lot of references to pop culture which was fun, but overall, the class was kind of stressful, there were a lot of assignments, lectures were kind of pointless because you just came to take the quiz, but since grading was easy you just have to do the assignments and you're good"
Daria Bahtina,NA,Variable Topics in Interpersonal Communication,COMM 188B,A-,"Professor Bahtina is so wonderful! She is very knowledgeable and informative. I also felt that she was very encouraging and cared about her students enough to even reach out to them via Slack or email. The grades were made up of Perusal annotations, research proposal, group project presentation, participation, and blog entry. Unfortunately, I don't remember exactly what the percentage weights are since I don't have access to the syllabus anymore, however, I feel that they range from 15-25% each and were all important to getting a good grade. Because the group quarter-long project is so important to the class and our grades, we were almost step-by-step guided through it which makes it so we have the opportunity to improve but also not be overwhelmed. Professor actually reached out to us after the end of the quarter for potential regrade of the blog because some of us were close to the next grade, which I found to be incredibly generous. She is that type of professor and so I would highly recommend her. So long as you stay focused and on top of the material, you will learn a lot and be rewarded with a good grade. Good luck!"
Daria Bahtina,NA,Variable Topics in Interpersonal Communication,COMM 188B,A+,"Professor Bahtina is an easygoing, kind, and helpful professor! This class is graded on Persuall annotations that are done throughout the quarter, participation, and the biggest grade being the group project, (there are NO test and quizzes!). The group project in this class had a few milestones to complete such as an annotated bibliography, meetings throughout the week with the T.A., research proposal, final research proposal, presentation, and blog post. Professor Bahtina is super helpful and her use of Slack to communicate with students was a great and quick way to get answers to questions. However, this may have just been a problem for Winter 2023, but the communication between the T.A. and Professor was lacking. At times us students in the class were being told one thing to do by the professor and then being told differently by the T.A. Lastly, I'd like to add that attendance was not mandatory and she did record lectures!Some personal suggestions I'd like to put out there if you are ever considering this class is if you dislike group projects, this class is NOT for you. It is heavily based on the group project so that is something to look out for. Also if you do take this class, you need to make sure you are in a group that works consistently and well together. Ultimately, this class is an easy A. As long as you and your group members keep up on assignments and work you should do great in the class."
Daria Bahtina,NA,Variable Topics in Interpersonal Communication,COMM 188B,A+,"Dr. Bahtina is the BEST!!!! This class was so great and I really wish I could've taken it in person. Dr. Bahtina is so nice and very understanding, making the class much more enjoyable and less stressful. The class is centered around a group project and blog post that you focus on for the entire quarter. There are no tests/quizzes, only weekly reading/annotation assignments which are very easy (mostly for participation). I would highly recommend this class, not only for the professor and workload, but also the topics covered are very interesting."
Carleen C Velez,NA,Current Methods of Language Teaching,LING M141,A-, Overall a good course. She is willing to work with you on assignments and getting a good grade is very easy and fair because her rubrics are very clear. Attendance and weekly readings are required so be prepared to stay consistent with attendance and weekly reading reading responses. You should expect to teach English (through tutoring) so that is pretty fun and you learn how to improve your own teaching style. Here is the course breakdown: Reading responses: 20%Group/Class Participation (Attendance): 20%Demonstration Lesson (Group Project): 20%Tutoring Journal: 20%Professional Development Artifact: 20%
Benjamin Lewis,NA,Elementary American Sign Language,ASL 1,A," FALL COVID ONLINE QUARTER Reviewing so that others taking a class with him during covid online quarters can know what to expectI LOVED this class. Ben is amazing and he's funny and tries to be as engaging as possible despite COVID online conditions.  He splits up the lecture so you'll end up having just one live lecture once a week, which is mandatory attendance but he also uploads videos teaching you the unit you will learn. The workload can be a little much, every two weeks there is a quiz, an interview with a classmate, and a video journal. However I think those assignments are necessary to keep up with learning the language, and the interviews are with different classmates each time so it's a great way to get to know people a bit. You just need to record some pre decided questions and answers for the interview and video journals. You also have one midterm one final and a final presentation. The presentation was graded way more kindly than the video journals in my opinion. You have to follow videos for all the exams and submit a PDF of your answers and sometimes they can sign a bit quickly but I think just going over the unit videos before class  is enough.  You'll also have a TA, we had a student who was amazing, she made a group chat for us and answers literally every single question you could have, as well really helping out during her tutoring hours (sort of like office hours) and was nice about finding other times to meet, would recommend going ove your final presentation with your TA so they can help you out with signs you're  unsure of. materials: you have to sign up for goreact which is a video streaming service and get the book signing naturally. The book didn't seem required  until the final where he asked one book specific question"
Benjamin Lewis,NA,Elementary American Sign Language,ASL 1,A+,"Ben is the best professor I have EVER had. He cares so much about his students and about this class, it's incredible. He has such a great sense of humor, going to class is so enjoyable. He really cares about his students learning the material and always makes sure everyone understands what is going on. His lectures are great, and he doesn't assign too much homework. 100% would take classes with Ben again"
Benjamin Lewis,NA,Elementary American Sign Language,ASL 1,A+,"Ben is one of my favorite professors from my time at UCLA. He cares a lot about his students' learning, and he works really well with the interpreter to make sure everyone understands what's going on in the class.  Ben's class is a lot of fun, which is good because you need to go to class in order to do well."
Benjamin Lewis,NA,Elementary American Sign Language,ASL 2,A,"Ben is probably THE best professor I've had at UCLA so far. He's extremely engaging, funny, and helpful. He's more than ready to help out a student during office hours and I've never had so much fun learning before. I really really recommend taking ASL if you can. It's definitely worth it!"
Benjamin Lewis,NA,Elementary American Sign Language,ASL 2,A-,"This class is amazing. By far my favorite class at UCLA and would be probably anyone's favorite class if they take it. Ben is hilarious and energetic, and very passionate about teaching. Him and his interpreter/assistant Miriam are very helpful and accommodating. Take this class if you want a rich experience and learn more about deaf culture, while learning ASL."
Benjamin Lewis,NA,Elementary American Sign Language,ASL 3,N/A,"Ben is an absolutely amazing professor! This class honestly feels more like a therapeutic fun session more than anything else, although you do learns tons about deaf culture and ASL. Very highly recommended!"
Benjamin Lewis,NA,Intensive Elementary American Sign Language,ASL 8,A+,"I took this class during the corona summer so it was quite different than the professors were used to. I personally was in LaTasha Clay's section (the entire class was split up into smaller discussions of about 8 students each between Ben, LaTasha, and Jennifer Marfino) and I absolutely adored her. The class was listed from 9:30am-3pm, but the actual class time was pretty short. Ben would post the lecture video (around 15-20 minutes long) at 9:30 each morning and you could watch it at your discretion, then you would attend section for 50 minutes at your assigned time (for us, either 1-1:50pm or 2-2:50pm). Ben always made sure to keep things fun by doing different group activities or games to study too, like jeopardy and family feud. The only thing about the class that was bit tougher (though still not super difficult) were the homework assignments. Twice a week we'd be assigned worksheets that were all pretty lengthy (classmates mentioned the optional textbook/workbook recommended for the class was very helpful). They would be posted at 9:30am and due by 12pm, which was a bit of a time crunch given the length, but homework wasn't weighted too heavily. We had weekly quizzes too, which were often easier than the worksheets. Also, Mariam, the class interpreter and tutor, will be your best friend! She is so sweet and a tremendous help with anything, from vocab to presentations to class logistics. Ben, LaTasha, Jennifer, and Mariam are an incredible team and so understanding and compassionate towards their students. Overall this was a super easy and super inspiring class, and I would highly highly recommend taking it with Ben!"
Benjamin Lewis,NA,Intensive Elementary American Sign Language,ASL 8,B,"Professor Lewis is a really good teacher! My TA was Kailyn and she was awesome too. All the instructors were always very clear on instruction/ information given out. They create a great atmosphere to learn ASL without judgement or fear of failing. They are very strict on late work or anything related to that, I turned in a journal late due to being in the ER and it was a zero. Definitely tanked my grade lol! Just make sure to get everything turned in on time and try not to miss any lecture or test."
Benjamin Lewis,NA,Intensive Elementary American Sign Language,ASL 8,A,"Ben is one of the best professors I've had at UCLA! Although the days seemed long at first for ASL 8, it gradually felt like an educational summer camp because of the activities and games that went on throughout the day. Ben's lectures are engaging and interactive, which makes learning ASL more immersive and makes for a more effective learning experience."
Benjamin Lewis,NA,Enforcing Normalcy: Deaf and Disability Studies,DIS STD M115,N/A,"Ben is one of the best professors I've had at UCLA!! This was such an eye-opening and engaging class. The grading scheme consists of weekly homework assignments (he posts readings on CCLE and has you answer 2-3 questions about them each week), one student question, a group project for the midterm, a short film review, and a 50 multiple-choice final exam. Mariam, the interpreter for the course, and Ben make such a great team. They really care about you learning and understanding the world in a new way. I highly recommend this class and this professor!"
Reynaldo F Macias,NA,Theoretical Concepts in Chicana and Chicano Studies,CHICANO 101,A+,"This class is overall pretty easy given that you receive an extra credit opportunity for every paper you turn in. Ex: the first exam may involve 3 mini-essays with 50 points each, and there's an extra credit question worth 50 points. So. you can see how just doing the extra credit can put you way ahead of the curve. I only went to 2 lectures in person, but Professor Macias records his lectures. But to be honest, you only really need to look at his slides then read to get an A on an essay. Your TA grades your papers and they were all pretty accommodating. The class gets easier as time goes by: the first exam had 3 mandatory questions, the second one had 2, and the third had 1 (all still having the 50-point extra credit question)."
Reynaldo F Macias,NA,Theoretical Concepts in Chicana and Chicano Studies,CHICANO 101,A,"I have taken several Chicana/o classes in the past as a requirement for GE's and the minor and this class by far was the worst. The class had a crazy amount of readings. I think if I had actually done all the readings it would've been maybe 9-10 hours of reading per week. The exams were not too bad, being that I never read or attended lecture. However I think they weren't that bad solely because our class spoke up on the amount of work. Professor is very old schooled. Grading system was a mess. I did not know my grade at any point of the quarter. Class is feasible. Class is not enjoyable. Professor spoke down on us claiming we had no reason to complain over the work given because ""our lives are so much easier then back in the day"". Overall, feasible class, but not enjoyable."
Reynaldo F Macias,NA,Theoretical Concepts in Chicana and Chicano Studies,CHICANO 101,A,"I took this class as a requirement for the Chicano Studies minor, and it almost made me reconsider the whole program. You know a class is bad when there are 300 students enrolled and by week 5 only a tiny fraction (like 30 people) are still attending in person. For this class, there are 3 midterms (one due finals week) that rely on the assigned readings each week. The easiness of this course depends on your TA. My TA was extremely helpful, but I heard horror stories about the other TAs. The exams would be one or two essay questions, plus an extra credit essay. However, towards the end of the quarter, the professor announced that extra credit would not be cumulative, and only applied to the assignment. Many students thought this was unfair, including the TAs, and they were overwhelmed by how difficult the professor made the grading system work. If this class is taught by another professor in the future, rejoice because no one is as bad as Professor Macias."
Reynaldo F Macias,NA,Theoretical Concepts in Chicana and Chicano Studies,CHICANO 101,F,Gives a ridiculous amount of readings and does not care for students' well-being. He preaches about social change however he shuts down students that spoke up when they shared their concerns that they thought he was being unfair to the class. Also tells you your opinions are wrong. I will say he is very passionate about the topic
Reynaldo F Macias,NA,Theoretical Concepts in Chicana and Chicano Studies,CHICANO 101,N/A,He gives you an overload of reading and not considerate of his students be patient and you can pass. He also gaslights his students on any opinion and ideas.
Reynaldo F Macias,NA,Theoretical Concepts in Chicana and Chicano Studies,CHICANO 101,A,"I chose this class with Professor Macias because I needed Chicano 101 for the Chican@ Minor. I was scared of him in the beginning  but I guess he has a resting serious face. Disadvantages of Macias:  He is very vocal (So he rarely uses Slides and lots of us had to bring laptops to type everything he says), expensive textbooks (But I learned sooo much from the readings), The TA's were confused by his instructions, he assigns lots of readings and even wanted us to do ""Matrices"" for them but the TA's stopped assigning them cause they were a waste of time. I'm a first year and I got an A!  I honestly think it was because my TA graded our assignments nicely lol. In the first week of Discussion, my TA said ""Professor Abrego is teaching this class in the Fall so maybe drop this class now if you don't like it because Macias asks for a lot."" That made me regret taking the class but honestly the readings were the only hardest part of the class. He gives 2 midterms and a final (But Macias calls them all midterms) and a Book Review.  They were take-home and a bit hard cause you have the find the info from the readings.  I took advantage of AAP's PLFs. That really helped me get an A. If you have to take this class with Macias because of your schedule then just take it because it is a nice experience."
J Kim,NA,Language and Gender: Introduction to Gender and Stereotypes,LING 40W,N/A," I too took Applied Linguists 40 (no W) and I enjoyed the class thorougly. Professor Kim is a very good teacher and she loves what she teaches. She reviews the material from the previous lecture at the beginning of each lecture, so if you missed class, it's easy to catch up. Plus she posts the lecture slides each week so you can download them and study them yourself. Professor Kim loves class interaction, and she definitely notices those who speak up and contribute to discussions (at the end of the course, she personally thanked each student who she remembered contributing to discussions.) Professor Kim also loves to use her children and her own personal life as examples when explaining concepts, which makes the lectures very enjoyable and interesting. There are often short videos and other supplemental materials that make the lectures interesting as well.  Overall, I really liked Professor Kim, and I think that she was a good, fair teacher. Unfortunately, I did not get a good grade in this class, but I contribute that more to my TA and her grading style + my lack of understanding of my final research paper topic (leading me to get a 50% on it :'( ) than Professor Kim's teaching. Professor Kim is straightforward and is always willing to answer any questions about the material. She is very kind and not intimidating at all! "
J Kim,NA,Language and Gender: Introduction to Gender and Stereotypes,LING 40W,N/A," Took appling40, no W. I surprisingly enjoyed this course. Made me realize things about language I never thought about before. Very intriguing class, I'm sure anybody who takes it will love it. Professor kim was passionate about the topics and it made me passionate about it too. All of her lectures were slides that she would post for a certain amount of time. I especially liked that at every start of class, she would review things from the previous lecture - making it easier to sort out the important key things to study. There were four quizzes, one every two weeks starting after the first couple weeks. They were around 10-12 questions each, timed, online. Most of them were key things from her lecture slides. Then there were two fieldwork reports where you choose your own topic based on the lesson from that week. I surprisingly had fun with these, analyzing aspects of the language in my every day life was exciting because I noticed patterns that I didn't even realize. The proposal and report had deadlines, but there were options of when you wanted your personal deadline to be. Then there was an in class exam as the final. I personally like having the last day of class be the test, getting it out of the way early. It was pretty straightforward. She gives lots of hints of what's going to be on it. The best part was there were so many options of what you wanted to answer. Like the multiple choice, there were (i think) 12 and you answered 10 (no bonus for extra answers). Then different graphs you could pick to analyze. Then an extra credit at the end where you create and answer your own question. Overall I liked this course and the professor. Also - she does have a slight accent, but it's not distracting at all and personally, it helped hold my attention even more."
Mary E Galvin,NA,Approaches to University Writing,ENGCOMP 2,A-,"Professor Galvin was overall a great professor, she took the time to explain assignments and was an easy professor to talk to, her assignments weren't hard and only took about a few hours. She also provides a few ways to get extra credit to help students. I am also selling her course reader for $25 if anyone is interested email me: aliyajackson292@gmail.com."
Mary E Galvin,NA,Approaches to University Writing,ENGCOMP 2I,B+,"This review is actually for ENG CCOMP 2 which I took with professor Galvin.  Her classes are boring and unengaging. Though I must say that the topics discussed in class are actually rather interesting. Professor Galvin has this special ability to lag, like a computer under a virus-attack. She possesses only one type of hear and it is slow, slow slow. Her processing is so slow and as a result, she mumbles unclear information in fragments and pieces, which makes the ambiguous information being presented even more confusing for us. Members of the class always have to whisper among ourselves to piece together the disintegrated information we may have, but that does not seem to work as well. Her classes are slow paced but relaxing. Though I cannot say I enjoyed this class, the class was reasonably easy and Professor is fair on work set."
Mary E Galvin,NA,Approaches to University Writing,ENGCOMP 2I,A,"Overall, the class was quite boring in my opinion. English is one of my least favorite subjects so that explains it. There are short readings (around 15 pages, sometimes less) for every class. In class, we would separate into groups and discuss the readings with our groups and then with the class. She then would go over language and structure to improve the writings and eliminate some common mistakes. There are three essays (around 1200 words each) in the quarter. First drafts are graded pretty generously(9.5 or 10 out of 10). Then you can choose two out of the three topics to submit revisions for, which you can get an A for if you take her advice from the first draft and conferences. There is also a group presentation and a final portfolio due at week 10, both of which she graded generously in my opinion. It was not a fun class for me, but it surely was an easy A."
Mary E Galvin,NA,Approaches to University Writing,ENGCOMP 2I,A-,"I had Professor Galvin for my fall quarter and enjoyed her class overall. Our topic was revolved around college/college lifestyle/admissions/fraternities,etc. and I found it quite interesting especially the readings/podcasts she assigned. The workload was not heavy at all, readings assigned for every class but not long at all and fairly interesting. In class, she would have us split into groups to discuss the readings and share with the class. Usually she would work on grammar/english writing structure afterward which I felt like we needed a couple more exercises to strengthen our writing.  She was very open and helpful in office hours/conferences which she has. We meet with her at least 3 times a quarter to discuss each essay we wrote. You are graded on self-improvement and not how you write compared to your class. You have 3 essays, a couple drafts and a final portfolio which she offers help for all essays if you are willing to meet her. Great professor in my opinion. Some may complain about their final grade but if you really want an A, go to her office hours, go to the undergraduate writing center or ask a couple friends to help you with your revisions. It's definitely possible and I enjoyed this class a ton."
Mary E Galvin,NA,Approaches to University Writing,ENGCOMP 2I,B,I tried very hard on my essays and she would hold office hours to go to her to review your essay before you submit it but honestly she was never really helpful or straight forward. She also gave the assignments on such short notice. This class was extremely boring that I was nearly going to kill myself.
Mary E Galvin,NA,Approaches to University Writing,ENGCOMP 2I,B+,"I worked really hard on my final drafts and still received a B in both corrections. The class overall is not difficult and she tries to help with small grammar problems. The class is often separated into groups which helps you meet new people and the final project is a group project, which sucks if you are the only one putting in work. Overall she was really nice and I would recommend her class, just make sure you work extra hard on your final drafts!"
Kinda Al Rifae,NA,Elementary Standard Arabic,ARABIC 1A,A+,"**I didn't have prof. Kinda Al Rifae, I had Brady Ryan (who was a grad student under her advisement I believe)**I loved this class; it was by far my favorite of the quarter. My professor was so well prepared  every time. I learned so much Arabic and got an amazing sense of achievement from this class. It did require a very high workload, but the workload was definitely worth it in my opinion since there was no busywork (everything we did was valuable). I will definitely be taking at least one more year, possibly even majoring in Arabic just from this class. Definitely recommend for anyone interested in learning a super fun and engaging language with very small class size."
Kinda Al Rifae,NA,Introduction to Language Learning and Language Teaching,APPLING 101W,A-,"Overall not bad class, the tasks are not very difficult, but they are terrifying in quantity. The professor is easily accessible; however, she's lagging in giving scores and feedback, and I have almost no clue what grade I'd get until the official grade is posted. More detrimentally, the class is very tedious and the materials are not very intriguing, though participation is strictly mandatory. An okay GE and writing II if you have trouble looking for them."
Susan Plann,NA,Fiat Lux Freshman Seminars,CHICANO 19,F,"The professor was unorganized in her lectures and didn't tolerate electronic notes. Many times it was difficult for the class to feel comfortable to participate, it was an awkward setting to be in. Did not tolerate tardiness in anyway, she doesn't even have sympathy for mental health appointments. Possibly believes her class is the most important one here at ucla but won't even communicate with her students. It was also awkward for a class that is about undocumented students and our difficult experiences to be shared with a woman who wasn't relatable in that way. Its an easy class, but overall, I would stay away from the professor."
Susan Plann,NA,Applied Linguistics,SPAN 115,N/A,"Excellent professor! Professor Plann is by far the best professor I've had at UCLA. She is very organized and her lectures are amazing! The first half of the quarter she set up groups of students to present the chapters that we would talk about during the week. After the midterm which was very straight forward (nothing like those horrible multiple choice exams),she continued to lecture and the final exam was  also very straight forward. She is always available during her office hours and a very nice person to talk to. I highly recommend Professor Plann."
Trevor Kann,NA,Linguistic Humor: Amusing and Abusing with Language,LING 9W,B+,Man this is my guy. I used to never be comfortable going to office hours but when I did go it was  like I was speaking to a friend thats just trying to help.  This class was really hard for me because I was never really a good writer but I wouldn't have made it without the support of the professor. He understood my situation and tried to accommodate as much as possible. He's really great at lecturing and he really knows how to engage the whole class.  There aren't really assignments its mostly papers and whats really great is that the drafts are reviewed by peers and the professor and not just one or the other.I highly recommend taking this class if you are advanced in writing research papers because it is challenging trying to write a research paper on linguistics and humour but also if youre a beginner it helps you think critically in a creative way and you will get the help you need to pass and succeed.
Trevor Kann,NA,Language in Action: Perspectives from Applied Linguistics,LING 11,A-,"Trevor is friendly and gives really engaging lectures. He only bothers people who actively participate, and he only took attendance for the days with guest lectures. There were no exams, just two papers, and a weekly reading reflection and homework. It's a lot of work, but it's spread out over the quarter and is mainly just busy-work. The grading is all up to the TA, who may be strict."
Trevor Kann,NA,Language in Action: Perspectives from Applied Linguistics,LING 11,B+,"This professor killed me. He literally has no respect for the students and the minorities. He just says whatever he wants. Kann does not know how to organize a class and it was the most boring lecture ever. He is just an outgrown frat boy and he makes all that type of jokes like ""oh just stick it in my ass and call me a big fat idiot"" like dude okay you are trying way too hard. Things he says are super not funny and make people really uncomfortable. One more thing, he is always like the ""best buddy"" with his TA so he trusts his TA 100% so he doesn't care if your TA wasn't grading fairly. Hopefully he's not gonna teach or stay at UCLA anymore and hopefully, I don't need to take any more of his classes."
Trevor Kann,NA,Language in Action: Perspectives from Applied Linguistics,LING 11,A,"Trevor Kann is super personable and I enjoyed his class. The rapport between him and the students is light and entertaining, unfortunately my class was a bit quiet so his witty remarks and attempts at engaging his students often went ignored. He is really understanding of tardiness, just be prepared to be put on the spot if you walk in late (in a lighthearted way). This class relies a lot on discussion so it is to the benefit of everyone to participate. This course covers a wide range of topics tackled by applied linguistics, and it was interesting to be exposed to all of these different areas. The workload is very manageable - weekly discussion posts, reading assignment (75-100 pages per week), weekly assignments and two papers, no exams. The papers aren't too challenging and you can use the assigned readings as sources as well as for topic inspiration. He brings in a lot of guest speakers which also keeps the class entertaining. Discussion was also very interesting and thought-provoking, sometimes I even felt as though I learned more in discussion than in lecture.  Overall this is a worthwhile class and I would recommend it to ling majors and anyone else who has an interest."
Trevor Kann,NA,Introduction to Language Learning and Language Teaching,APPLING 101W,B+,"This is a review for APPLING 101W. The class itself is a very interesting subject and Professor Kann was a good lecturer. However, I would not recommend this class because of how difficult it is to get an A. Here are some reasons why:1) Flat scale. Every point matters. It's still possible, but I wasn't aware it was so strict and not very clear on the syllabus.2) rough drafts for written assignments are graded (pretty harshly as well) and a considerable part of your grade. (16%) There's also a different rubric for the final draft, so if you do well on the rough draft, it doesn't mean you'll do well on the final draft.3) The group project can be hit or miss and requires a lot of effort/office hours. (10% of grade)4) attendance matters! You can't miss a SINGLE lecture or you lose points(unfortunately the class was at 8 am)! If you're not paying attention you also lose some points. Unfortunately, lecture isn't that important for the class either yet you are expected to pay attention (readings much more). Not clear on the syllabus. (10%)5) 4 different types of essays of nuanced essays with different expectations. Wasn't very clear at times and based on what TA you get. TA office hours for the rough draft is very important.6) Grades came in very late (cause essays take a long time to grade!) so you won't know what you got until the very end, and you can't really do anything about your grade."
Trevor Kann,NA,Fundamentals of Translation and Interpreting,LING 144,N/A,"Prof. Trevor Kann is a very patient and hard working instructor. He prepares each lecture with a lot of informations. In real, for his class, there is no need for a TA.    Highly recommend taking his classes."
Trevor Kann,NA,Fundamentals of Translation and Interpreting,LING 144,N/A,"This class was so annoying. The class is unorganized, TA doesn't know what is going on in the class. The TA and the professor do not communicate well, they say different things. I am a straight-A student, worked my butt off, but still ended up with B+. Took this for my last quarter, and I regret it very much."
Trevor Kann,NA,Language and Society: Introduction to Sociolinguistics,LING 170,A, Take this class to relax (and give a boost to your gpa). Make sure to choose a good topic for your research proposal because this is what your grade depends on.
Trevor Kann,NA,Language and Society: Introduction to Sociolinguistics,LING 170,A+,"Very laid-back class with a light courseload. Be sure to show  up to class though, he likes to give random quizzes (not difficult) throughout the quarter and they will just bump your grade higher. Whole class revolves around prepping for the final paper, which is a research proposal. Students also give a presentation of their proposal to the class, meaning the last two weeks of the quarter are just presentations."

Linda Jensen,NA,Introduction to Language Learning and Language Teaching,APPLING 101W,N/A,"Linda is absolutely by far my favorite teacher at UCLA. Her enthusiasm for teaching and for personally helping each student is evident not only in class, but also in her accessibility outside of class. There is no BS work in this class. Regardless of how decent you believe your writing skills are, they will doubtlessly improve with Linda and the TA's assistance. This class fills up very quickly, so get in while you can!"
Ingrid Norrmann-Vigil,NA,High-Intermediate Composition for Multilingual Students,ENGCOMP 1B,F,"I took her for Engcomp 6W and she is literally the worst professor I've ever had in all of my undergrad. I've never written a Bruinwalk review because I've never felt the need to but this professor is SO BAD that I feel the need to warn everyone about her. She's given me so much stress and anxiety through just one quarter that no one should take her if they care about their mental health. She is also a pretty terrible person, I visited her in office hours to look for help but she was so rude and makes you feel stupid and then she'll blame you for not understanding the content of the class. The content of the class is very misleading/not very helpful when you're writing your research paper, she has TOO MANY assignments, she does not accept late homework, and just not understanding of student issues/needs. Most HEARTLESS, RUDE, and INCONSIDERATE professor let alone person I've met. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS, I'M WARNING YOU!"
Ingrid Norrmann-Vigil,NA,High-Intermediate Composition for Multilingual Students,ENGCOMP 1B,F,"Actually took her for Eng.Comp.6W:Worst professor I have taken in my 4 years at UCLA. She has done her PhD in linguistics and she completely formed the class based on her obsession with her PhD dissertation rather than the actual class requirements. Its an english composition class, not a linguistics class. If I wanted to take linguistics I would have. She is the worst. I have never written a review about a professor until now, but I feel the need to do so for this professor. Avoid her at all costs."

Ingrid Norrmann-Vigil,NA,"Language, Culture, and Discourse",ENGCOMP 6W,A,"Overall I'd say this class was challenging. The class/topic itself was not difficult and it was actually mildly interesting which is saying a lot considering I have 0 interest in linguistics, but the workload was pretty hefty. The class consisted of writing a 15+ page research paper, that was divided into sections that were turned in throughout the quarter. The professor requires you to buy a 200+ page course reader (***Selling course reader, price negotiable. If interested text me at (213) 529-5916***) to complete a weekly discussion post, that was actually not difficult if you just skim the readings, the only articles you actually have to read are the ones you will use for your research paper. I found the lectures were helpful at clarifying the readings although the class is 2 hours long, so it can get boring. In my experience, the professor was helpful. I would usually approach her after class with any questions and she always clarified all of them. Overall this class was not terrible, it's definitely not an easy A but an A is not impossible."

Ingrid Norrmann-Vigil,NA,"Language, Culture, and Discourse",ENGCOMP 6W,C+," I actually had to quit my job in order to keep up with the workload of the least engaging class I have ever taken.  Somehow, we had a constant flow of tedious assignments, yet every single class it felt we were repeating the same material.  I usually am eager at the opportunity to write or take an English class. However, there is a first time for everything.  She says she wants to help, but I came to office hours multiple times, and as the other reviews on RatemyProfessor say, she treats you like you're stupid when you don't understand and ask questions.  As an assignment, we had to visit the research consultation center in order to gain credit for an essay. When I gave her my consultation slip she refused to count it because I had my consultation in a different building than Powell.   That was honestly the longest ten weeks of my life and class was only two times a week."
Ingrid Norrmann-Vigil,NA,"Language, Culture, and Discourse",ENGCOMP 6W,C+," This is BY FAR THE WORST CLASS I have taken at UCLA. Ingrid is AWFUL, as is the subject! If analyzing clips of conversation, measuring pauses and the breaths people take, and then  writing a 15 page research paper about them sounds like a good time to you, then you should definitely take this class. If not, you definitely should not take this class! Ingrid's lectures and assignments are so boring and dry. She's not fun or relatable at all, and she doesn't seem to comprehend that her students are just there to fulfill their writing II and don't actually give a shit about transcribing excerpts of conversations as a poor excuse for science.  It's not an inherently difficult class, but it is a lot of work that's a complete waste of time. I never had a harder time getting myself to just sit my ass down and bullshit an assignment, leading me to miss the deadline on several assignments. On top of how terrible the class is in general, I also got screwed over by Ingrid, and I'm pretty sure I was not the only one. I submitted a research proposal and my intro and methods weeks 3 and 4, respectively... got As on both of those. Then I submitted my results and discussion and the rest of the paper. I got my results and discussion feedback week 9, the day before the video presentation deadline, saying that my research topic was invalid and I had to redo the entire thing. WHY THE FUCK DIDN'T SHE THINK TO MENTION THAT IN WEEKS 3 OR 4 WHEN SHE LOVED MY PROPOSAL AND THESIS STATEMENT?!?! Needless to say, I didn't have much time to deal with that, so I just took the hit, did what I needed to pass, and watched my GPA take a nosedive.  If I could go back in time, the first thing I would do is not take this class!"
Ingrid Norrmann-Vigil,NA,"Language, Culture, and Discourse",ENGCOMP 6W,A,"This class is not necessarily difficult to do well in, but it is a lot more effort than it's worth. Not to mention that linguistics is terribly boring (unless you're into it I guess?). Anyway, although some of the other reviews are a little dramatic, I agree with the sentiment. My biggest complaint is that she grades you on an entire paper about linguistic analysis without even going into much detail about the subject in lecture. This can make picking a topic really difficult because you might not really know what to look for (I felt this way, especially as a STEM major with no clue about linguistics). While she will help you out if you seek it, she is not a very approachable person. She always seemed condescending to me when I asked her questions.  The workload can get pretty intense; don't take this class if you're looking to do minimal work for a writing II. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this class unless you're really into linguistics because I felt like I put in a lot of time and effort into a subject that was absolutely not worth that much of my time."
Ingrid Norrmann-Vigil,NA,"Language, Culture, and Discourse",ENGCOMP 6W,A+,"A lot of people complain about her class, but it really isn't that bad. As long as you are a decent writer going into this it'll be fine. She structures the class so the entire quarter you focus on writing one research paper. by week 8 you're pretty much done with everything. Be warned that the course reader seems formidable clocking in at 400 pages but you really only need to read it in depth for the articles that you will be focusing your writing around. Everything else you can briefly skim to write your summary on, and you won't be responsible for that material anyway. I always found that she was actually helpful in office hours as long as you go in with specific questions about your writing. She is more than willing to read it over and point you in the right direction. Make sure your research topic is actually interesting to you (more importantly interesting to her as well), so you don't hate yourself for spending so much time watching it. The class is based on linguistic analysis which focuses on HOW people say something rather than just what they say which can be difficult for some to grasp. IF that's the case go to her early on and express that concern, and Im sure shell help point you in the right direction. She gives detailed rubrics for what she is going to look for, and she lectures on how to construct the various sections of the paper. Honestly, her class isn't that bad and you should be fine in it if you actually put in the effort to write well."

Ingrid Norrmann-Vigil,NA,Language and Gender: Introduction to Gender and Stereotypes,LING 40W,F,"I took her for EngComp6W and it is a HORRIBLE class. Do not take it. Her grading scheme is ridiculous as the entire class is based on a linguistic analysis research paper that requires you to know everything about the field of linguistics in Week 2, or she’ll completely destroy your grade by Week 7.  She grades rough drafts incredibly hard (30% of your final grade) and harshly criticizes students’ papers and ideas when little to no advice or lessons were taught on the features we were supposed to analyze. She is a rude and unapproachable professor who wants her class to be a 20+ hour commitment in your life despite everyone taking it as a desperate Writing 2 requirement. She is rude to students in office hours and in class, and provides nothing but criticism and scrutiny when you ask for help. I’ve never felt the need to write a review about a professor before, but considering she doesn’t allow for teacher evaluations, I felt like people needed to know how awful this class was before they try to enroll in it."
Ingrid Norrmann-Vigil,NA,Language and Gender: Introduction to Gender and Stereotypes,LING 40W,A,"Workload is so FUCKING intense. Like unreal at times. However, material is very interesting and can be pretty thought provoking. Take class at your own risk!"
Ingrid Norrmann-Vigil,NA,Introduction to Language Learning and Language Teaching,APPLING 101W,F,"Actually took her for Eng.Comp.6W. The workload is way too much, and totally not worth it. The class literally has 10-12 graded components, its actually insane. I would never take another class with this professor. She is one of the professors who feels that her class has to be the center of your life and purposely makes it out of this world demanding."
Ingrid Norrmann-Vigil,NA,Introduction to Language Learning and Language Teaching,APPLING 101W,B,"Don't take her class.Her class will shorten your life expectancy by at least a decade. She has approximately 40 different ""stylistic"" factors that she takes points off for a 30 point essay. Well I am not even gonna talk about her rubric for the content criteria. Her goal seems not to focused on  teaching students. Rather, the class seems to be driven by the instructor's sadistic need to torment students. (I participated, by that I mean read material beforehand and actually participated in debate very enthusiastically, but at the end, I found out that out of 10 participation grade she assigns for every single class, she would never, not even a single time, give a perfect score for participation, but always a nine at the best. This truly reflects her tendency. She does not want to give you good grades. She seems to be thinking that giving good grade somehow drops her status as a professor?) I probably learned a lot. However, I am telling you. Not worth it if you are just trying to satisfy your graduation requirement.  Of course you will be able to get A if you try really hard. But she actually says this at the beginning of the instruction, she wants you to spend at least 20 hours a week for her class. No disrespect, but her class is not even close to being one of the most useful or important classes at UCLA. 20 hours a week...? seriously think about it again before you take this extremely self absorbed instructor's class.(amount of respect she demands, and I am telling you I come from South Korean public education, so I know all that physical discipline, respect for teacher and all that shit in one of the most extreme forms, is truly insane. She seems to be having some kind of obsession on having patriarchal control over the whole class. She explicitly says that leaving early or coming late(even like 10 mins, lecture was 3 hours), even if it is due to class conflict, is a sign of disrespect and points will be deducted. I took her class during my last senior summer and if it weren't for her class, I can say for sure, my summer would have been so much better."
Olga T Yokoyama,NA,Never-Ending Stories: Multidisciplinary Perspectives on Myth,CLUSTER 30A,A," Professor Yokoyama is a very nice person. She likes to crack jokes during her lectures and dresses snazzy on holidays. As for her lectures, I wouldn't say they were the best but they also weren't the worst. She assigns a lot of reading for her lectures, but at least you can understand them and it isn't like a bunch of scholarly articles. I would say that the topics she lectures on in particular for the cluster are interesting themselves, but Professor Yokoyama as a lecturer isn't the best. Sometimes her voice is a little low, so make sure you tell her to turn her mike up or adjust its placement. Pay attention to all the lectures, especially hers because the quizzes have a lot of her lecture material on there. The class itself is manageable. There is a lot of reading assigned, but  you can get away with just skimming some of it and reading parts of it. Go to lecture and discussion and pay attention there. Don't avoid reading, but remember that SparkNotes is an option when it comes to the actual books. There are four quizzes and the lowest score is dropped. The last quiz itself has a bonus point for if you went to movie night and paid attention. If it's a movie you've already seen then you can usually get away with not going to movie night and still getting the bonus point. No matter how many movie nights you attend, remember that you can only gain one point. There are two essays, and they are fair enough. Go to your TA's office hours and discussion to see what it is your TA wants to see in your writing (the actual professors that lecture don't ever look at your papers). Treat the rough draft like it is the final draft and make the proper revisions to get a better score on the final draft. But seriously, go to your TA's office hours or even email them with your questions because they're willing to help (thanks Jonathan!)."
Olga T Yokoyama,NA,Student Research Program,SLAVC 99,N/A,"THIS CLASS IS RIDICULOUS. I have to say I never read anything in this class, and lectures were very boring.  Overall, the class is not hard, but I felt like it was not beneficial to me.  Yokoyama is hard to figure out, her lectures are all power point and tedious.  The midterm and final ended up being take home becuase they were so hard. I would not recommend this class unless you really need it and like the dull ones!"
Olga T Yokoyama,NA,Student Research Program,SLAVC 99,N/A,"Although the readings for the course are a bit tedious, Professor Yokoyama doesn't expect her students to read everything.  She knows that her class is not reading and she is fine with it.  As for her tests, reviewing the online notes is a good way to prepare for them.  Overall, Yokoyama is an okay professor, though her lectures can get very confusing and boring at times."
Lyle Bachman,NA,Language in Action: Perspectives from Applied Linguistics,APPLING 10,N/A," This isn't a bad course to take for a writing II requirement plus two GEs. Note: discussions and lecture attendance is mandatory. Overall, lectures are dull. Before class, you have to read the related texts. Most of the time, these are studies that the guest lecturers conducted. Which is more than fine, but when they come in to talk about them, they rarely ever add anything to what their papers said. Most topics are interesting, however, and when the professors/experts do expand on the readings, the material can be quite engaging. The discussions are also pretty useless. My TA was super nice and tried to keep us interested, but there really wasn't much to cover, in my opinion. Most were centered around discussion questions that students wrote as part of their homework. (Hopefully that gives you some idea of how banal they were.) The papers aren't too hard, really. The first one especially. Just make sure you follow the rubric (its organization and what it says you need to define within the parameters of your paper) and you'll do well. Your TA will tell you for the second paper that you'll have to cut down a lot because, if you pick your topic well, you'll just want to keep going. I, along with the rest of the class, dismissed this as BS each time it was brought up, but it's actually true. If I were an AppLing major, I definitely would've just kept going after turning in the shortened version. As it were, I wasn't that motivated, but the paper was easier than I thought once I got started. All in all, this is a paper-based class, so how well you do depends on how much time you're willing to spend tailoring your paper to the class/rubric and how kind of a grader your TA is. All the TAs for my class seemed like they wouldn't be too harsh, but I guess you never really know. I had Ashley Micklos and I'd definitely recommend her, as a teacher and a fair grader. In case you believe grades bias reviews, I got an A."
Lyle Bachman,NA,Foundations of Language Assessment,APPLING C157,N/A,STAY AWAY FROM THIS CLASS. dont waist your time. you get nothing from him.
Lyle Bachman,NA,Social Foundations of Language,APPLING M206,N/A," Audited a class with him when in attendance at UCLA last year.I mentioned that I audited the class so you know there is no personal stake to settle, but rather a non-grade related performance evaluation. Let me preface this by saying I have much admiration and respect for the linguistics and applied linguistics departments, including the majority of its staff and faculty alike.  I am known for being honest, respectful, and typically easy on professor assessments simply so you know the degree to which Professor Bachman's personal tact and overall interpersonal skills are severely deficient.  Overall a terrible professor.  Disconnected, uninterested, passionate/tenacious--but what good is that if he is not only a sub-par lecturer, but an intrinsically cruel personal individual with little tact in dealing with his students on an individual scope.  Appears to have very little concern & interest in teaching and passing on knowledge than his research.  Perhaps UCLA should allow research only oriented professors to be given the opportunity to do just that--research only...they should not be allowed to step foot in a lecture hall till they undergo social communications evaluations--as in Professor Bachman's case--the component which is lacking almost entirely. Unfit for a classroom.  Good luck with his classes.  I feel sorry for his spouse or significant other.  Might seem cruel and tactless myself to say the aforementioned, but no less on point.  Don't think I've ever seen a professor at UCLA of which I would reserve similar harsh truths.  Most are fantastic at UCLA...not Bachman, he is simply not in keeping with UCLA's tradition of excellence."
Robert S Kirsner,NA,German Language Laboratory,GERMAN Z,N/A,"I took Honors Collegium 84: Conflict Between Languages with this man, and while he is very nice, he is completely incompetent as a professor.  He is not prepared, organized, and will not tell you what he expects.  His classes were a waste of my time and a waste of UCLA money.  He has several complaints against him, bombards your email with Dutch propaganda, and is pretty sure everyone speaks Dutch.  Once again, he is a very nice man, but very misguided.  You will constantly worry about your grade in his class because you're never sure what it is."
Robert S Kirsner,NA,Elementary German,GERMAN 1,N/A,"Though listed under German studies, he also regurgitated his tangents in other foriegn language/literature courses. Already warned and criticized by the dept. chair(s), he continues his 99% babble and 1% course related lectures. In a classroom that started out with 15+ people, size says it all in one now of 6, including an old 65 year cracker who ""Has nothing else to do.""  In lectures that sound more like AA meetings centered solely on him, his autobiographical sprees explicate more about his own shattered marraige, love of Star Trek, and fundamentalist Christian friends than the assigned material your assignments, tests and grades are based on. Based on the philosophy that lectures clarifying his various irritatingly thick, serotonin triggering novels is the equivalent of him doing the reading for us, he justifies and continues his routine tangents.

Robert S Kirsner,NA,From Oppressed to Oppressor and Beyond: Literature in Afrikaans from Preapartheid to Postapartheid Era in English Translation,AFRKAAN 40,A,"Afrikaans 40 was honestly the easiest GE I took. There is quite a bit of reading but what is nice is the fact that the readings are fictional rather than a textbook with technical material. For each reading he'd ask for a one page response, literally could be anything. And the final paper was a 10 page paper on any topic of your choosing."
Robert S Kirsner,NA,Conflicts between Languages,HNRS 84,N/A,"This class requires a lot of reading, and a 12-15 page paper about a conflict between language. The lectures are not organized, its mostly Kirsner sharing his own experinces with language. Its very informal, and during class very little is asked of you. I think if you are a linguistic's major you would enjoy this class more."
Ashley Micklos,NA,Selected Topics in Linguistic Anthropology,ANTHRO 159,C+,"Not a huge fan. She was intimidating on the first day, strictly warning students we wouldn't even be able to leave our house for our take-home midterm because it was going to be THAT rigorous. Well, she wasn't kidding. So, the subject matter is fascinating of course, but Micklo's instructions were not ever clear to me and many other students. Most of the class got a C or below on the midterm and students were LINED UP outside her office for office hours. This class is based on pure memorization of terms. I found myself working extremely hard only for her to continuously find deficiencies in my work without offering clear advice."
