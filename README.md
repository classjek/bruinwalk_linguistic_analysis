# A Computational Linguistic Analysis of BruinWalk

What's up team 

Here are the libraries we are currently looking into. I am leaning toward GloVe because it is included in the fast.ai library:   
[word2vec](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html)    
[GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) 


And here is a cool course:  
[Practical Deep Learning](https://course.fast.ai/)

Bruinwalk also doesn't include gender so we will also be training a model to do that. Below is an article by someone who did something similar as well as an API that we can compare out results to. And in cases where our model is unsure, we can check it by hand.
