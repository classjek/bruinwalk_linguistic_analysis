# A Computational Linguistic Analysis of BruinWalk

What's up team 

Here are a couple of papers that have inspired this project.  
[A Framework for the Computation Linguistic Analysis of Dehumanization](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7861242/)  
[Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis](https://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/acl11-WordVectorsSentimentAnalysis.pdf)


Here are the libraries we are currently looking into. I am leaning toward GloVe because it is included in the fast.ai library:   
[word2vec](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html)    
[GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) 


And here is a cool course:  
[Practical Deep Learning](https://course.fast.ai/)  
And another  
[fast.ai word embeddings workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25nC0n9ERq4)  


Bruinwalk also doesn't include gender so we will also be training a model to do that. Below is an article by someone who did something similar as well as an API that we can compare out results to. And in cases where our model is unsure, we can check it by hand.  
[Boy or Girl?](https://towardsdatascience.com/boy-or-girl-a-machine-learning-web-app-to-detect-gender-from-name-16dc0331716c)  
[Gender-API](gender-api.com)

I have also been reading about a concept called Datasheets for Datasets. It is basically a thoughtful acknowledgement and documentation of how the data was sourced, how we accessed it, and its potential flaws. Here is where you can read more about it:
