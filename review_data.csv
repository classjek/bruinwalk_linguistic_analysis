J.R. Liscombe,NA,Heritage and Values,dummyName,A,"This class is taken by AFROTC cadets during their first year and it is the first class in the Aerospace Studies 1 series. Professor Liscombe was funny, engaging and provided all the materials for this class at no cost.  The assignments and exams aren't too difficult as long as you study the weekly readings which are about a page or so."
W E Peris,NA,Introduction to American Politics,dummyName,A+," I took this during spring COVID quarter (online), so just keep that in mind. Peris seems like a really nice guy, and was super accomodating through all the craziness going on in the world. He lessened our workload, and the midterm was really fair considering all the content we went over. He made the final optional and eased the grading scale a bunch, too. His lectures were engaging and funny at times, and he even connected his lectures to some current events, which was interesting. I really enjoyed his approach to the class.  PS he did get in trouble for saying the n-word while reading MLK's Birmingham letter during the George Floyd protests. He obviously shouldn't have done it, and it was hurtful people (esp BIPOC) even though he emphasized that he was saying it for historical context, and not to be malicious.  His apology seemed genuine, and if it wasn't for that, I think he would really represent UCLA well as a full time prof."
W E Peris,NA,Introduction to American Politics,dummyName,A+,"Overall, Professor Peris did a solid job as the lecturer for Poli Sci 40. Although the lecture on systemic racism in which he read from MLK's ""Letter from a Birmingham Jail"" (which contains the n-word), will likely overshadow other moments in this class, Professor Peris did a great job preparing a well-organized, interesting, and engaging course. I would welcome the opportunity to take another class with him in the future."
W E Peris,NA,Introduction to American Politics,dummyName,A," TAKE THIS CLASS!! I highly recommend POL SCI 40 with Peris! Peris is a wonderful professor and I always look forward to attending his lectures. His lectures are recorded so it is fine if you happen to miss class. His exams are straightforward and easy so the path to an A is very attainable.  The discussion sections are also pretty fun and chill. My TA was Claudia and I really enjoyed having her since she's caring and helpful.  Overall, this is a great class for fulfilling the Pol Sci prereq, GE, or just a fun class! You won't regret taking it!"
W E Peris,NA,Introduction to American Politics,dummyName,A,I know he had an N word scandal but besides that he was really good. The lectures were extremely clear and I totally understood everything he said all the time. There was a ton of reading which is important if you plan to take the quizzes but I don't this you really need to do it if not. The workload was on the higher end but certainly not impossible.
W E Peris,NA,Introduction to American Politics,dummyName,A,"Loved this class, honestly. I had a pretty solid background of American politics from AP US Gov but I think Peris definitely added on and enhanced my understanding of the topic. He has good slides, lectures well, and is very knowledgeable. I thought the grading was very fair and the assignments were actually kind of fun. We had to write I believe five essays about certain topics, but they hardly involved any research and took me maybe two hours each. I think he made the class a bit more bearable for COVID and all tests and quizzes (quizzes were based on reading) were open note, but they were overall easy anyways. He also did a good job of incorporating current events into his lectures, especially since the election fell in the middle of the quarter. Cares about student's learning as well. 11/10 would recommend. I really enjoyed going to lecture. And he has two cats that meow in the backgrounds sometimes."
W E Peris,NA,Introduction to American Politics,dummyName,A,"Great class and professor! Peris is very knowledgeable about American politics and made even the more mundane parts of the course content interesting. There's a lot of reading, but in my experience you don't really need to do it all. Definitely take this class!"
W E Peris,NA,Introduction to American Politics,dummyName,A,"I took PS40 with Professor Peris during COVID, so the structure of the class could be different from an in-person class. Professor Peris is incredibly knowledgeable about American politics, and I found it really rewarding to take the class with him. I've honestly learned so much about American politics from his lectures. The exams were fairly graded, and if you take good notes and understand the concepts thoroughly you will be able to get a good grade :)"
W E Peris,NA,Introduction to American Politics,dummyName,A,"There is a lot of reading, but I did learn a lot from this class."
W E Peris,NA,Introduction to American Politics,dummyName,A,"One of the best professors to teach Poli Sci 40, Professor Peris made the optimal use of the resources given, and allowed the students to really understand the subject in depth. He is fair about grading, and gives a lot of notice in advance when he wants an assignment or quiz done in a particular way. The homework assignments are not ridiculous and very much doable, while the exams are highly focused on the syllabus, and do not include concepts from outside the syllabus. Excellent stuff!"
W E Peris,NA,Introduction to American Politics,dummyName,A+,"Peris was a great professor who spent a lot of time composing his lecture slides and delivering engaging lectures. His presentation of the material was clear, concise, and he really only mentions and emphasizes the most important aspects of the topics we learn. Textbook is a good read, although his slides and presentations are more than enough for the tests if you take good notes. During my quarter, he got in trouble for his last lecture, but it was an honest mistake that he apologized profusely for and only did for the sake of ""historic context"". Would be really sad to hear if he got fired for this reason - he is a great teacher that simply made a mistake. Would take his class again."
W E Peris,NA,Introduction to American Politics,dummyName,A+,"Good professor with very clear, detailed slides that he uploads after every lecture. Midterm and Final format includes a long essay, some short answers, and some multiple choice, but as long as you pay attention in lecture and read parts of the textbook, this class is not that difficult. Selling the required textbook for this class $35 @madising.21@gmail.com"
W E Peris,NA,Introduction to American Politics,dummyName,A,"(CORONA REVIEW) Being made online, the class consisted of a midterm, weekly homework assignments (ended up being changed to only 4), a final, and optional weekly quizzes. Very easy to keep up with the weekly topics and attendance was required in discussion sections with participation being accounted for. Homework assignments were 2-3 pages of double spaced writing about a few guiding questions about the week's topic. Midterm had multiple choice, short answers, and an essay, but majority of the people I know didn't even end up getting to finish their essay completely. The final ended up becoming optional given a few different events that required correction from the Poli Sci department. Overall, a pretty easy class that allowed for conversation and study of modern American politics."
W E Peris,NA,Introduction to American Politics,dummyName,A+,"Lectures were clear and engaging. Peris wove in current events to explain political concepts, which made the content a lot easier for me to follow. There were 7 optional quizzes that were all multiple choice and could be used to help raise your grade. The midterm consisted of 25 multiple choice questions, 10 short answers (worth 5 points each), and an essay (worth 25 points). I think the average was 90 so everyone did pretty well. There were 7 homework assignments, but we could choose 4 to do. The assignments were essay responses to a prompt that tied in with the lectures. There was a two page minimum. We were given a ""life happens"" pass at the beginning of the quarter that could excuse any late assignment. The final ended up being an optional essay. For the most part, Peris was accommodating and understanding. He cares about his students and their learning."
W E Peris,NA,Introduction to American Politics,dummyName,B+,"Ajax definitely cared about his students and was always available to answer questions. Grading is based on participation/pop quizzes, midterm, final, and term paper. Be prepared for lots of reading each class."
W E Peris,NA,Introduction to American Politics,dummyName,A,"Very fair professor and actually a very nice guy if you talk to him during office hours.  The class is very interesting but there is a lot of reading.  Study hard and you should be fine.Pay very close attention to the first 3 chapters, as their themes show up extensively throughout the course and in later chapters (make those connections)."
W E Peris,NA,National Institutions: Congress,dummyName,A,Take him.
W E Peris,NA,National Institutions: Congress,dummyName,N/A," Good Class.  Grading is interesting in that it reminded me a bit of high school -- less emphasis on exams, more emphasis on various ""assignments"" spaced out throughout the quarter. One of the assignments is a ""congressional simulation"" in which people make speeches, propose bills, etc. in front of the entire class. In my opinion, some people took this way, way too seriously and it kind of ruined it for others (swearing, arguing, one-uping people by making actual social media profiles of themselves as ""congressmen""). I'm assuming there are people who do this every quarter.  Perris is a great lecturer. Slides are super clear, no BS, he has clearly put a lot of thought into the course. Final exam and midterm were exceptionally straightforward, online, and open note.  In conclusion, this class is unlike normal Pol Sci courses in that your grade isn't based on just a midterm and final. Your grade in this class is based on a variety of quizzes, homework assignments (ie. short papers), your ""simulation"" participation, a small project, and 2 exams -- all of which are graded very fairly. If that sounds good to you, take this class. However, if you don't like the idea of constantly checking in/ participating in one course (ie. you prefer taking 2 tests and getting them over with), then it may be a good idea to avoid this."
W E Peris,NA,National Institutions: Congress,dummyName,A+,"This class was 3 homework assignments, the Congress simulation, 7 quizzes, the midterm, and the final. This seems like a lot, but it wasn't! Pretty manageable even with the simulation where I had a lot of extra work since I took on a leadership position within the ""Senate"". It was pretty fun participating because it led to more interaction between students. The homeworks were fine and I didn't stress over them too much! The midterm and final were take-home and pretty doable!"
W E Peris,NA,National Institutions: Congress,dummyName,A-,"This was my last political science class needed and I felt it was a decent way to go out. The class has three homework assignments where you research a congressperson/committee. Then you have a midterm and final along with a congressional simulation where you pretend to be a US senator through legislation/social media/floor debates/a final campaign ad and more. Its a very fair class and although I barely attended because of my jobs, I still got a good grade and learned a lot."
W E Peris,NA,National Institutions: Congress,dummyName,A+,"During my entire undergraduate career, I have never had such an engaged, passionate, helpful, and caring Professor. Professor Peris has the ability to make even the dullest topics entertaining. During class, he always makes sure to answer every student's question effectively, always staying after class to answer any remaining questions. I have made it a priority to attend his office hours almost every week. Professor Peris is always very welcoming and makes sure to answer my questions, even if we go over time. In the past, whenever I would attempt to do outside learning on the course material and ask my professor about it, I would get very sparse answers. Professor Peris, on the other hand, welcomes this type of inquiry. Had he not been teaching this class, I could assure you that I would think studying Congress was incredibly mundane. Now, I have decided to apply to different Ph.D. programs because I have realized how fascinating Congress is and how many questions I have left. I have been able to apply so much of the course content to contemporary events, and I have generated so many research questions just from discussing the course content with Professor Peris. He seems to truly care about students' concerns and goes out of his way to hear their feedback. If you are willing to put in the work to get a good grade for the congressional simulation, he will guide you through it and tell you exactly what you need to do to obtain full credit. He is an incredibly straightforward and fair grader. I am so thankful to have enrolled in this class. Professor Peris represents the best UCLA has to offer and has already made such a large impact on my academic journey. I just wish he taught more classes!!"
W E Peris,NA,National Institutions: Congress,dummyName,A,Peris is pretty chill and this class is an easy A. There are optional quizzes that a pretty as long as you do the reading.You also have to write a weekly report on a congressional committee which get easier as the quarter progresses but I always got 10/10. Would take Peris Again
W E Peris,NA,National Institutions: Congress,dummyName,A,"I enjoyed taking this class with Professor Peris, and the timing of the course in the context of the subject matter of Congress and the events of early 2021 made for a particularly exciting and engaging course.  Professor Peris' class was very straightforward and his lectures were organized (and recorded).   I feel as though I learned a lot and the workload was light.  No large writing assignments besides 8 weekly reports on a committee in Congress, but these were not overly time consuming.  Optional quizzes and the midterm/final were straightforward if you studied (and likely not horrible even if you did not review, as he also held reviews in class)."
W E Peris,NA,National Institutions: Congress,dummyName,A,"One of my favorite PS upper div classes! Peris is an amazing and organized lecturer, the content is interesting, and the structure of the course is good as well. Easy weekly assignments and reading quizzes that make up half of your grade and the midterm/final are easy to do well on if you pay attention in lecture. Definitely recommend this  course!!!"
W E Peris,NA,"Electoral Politics: Elections, Media, and Strategy",dummyName,A,"I enjoyed taking this course with Professor Ajax. His courses always seem to be organized and manageable. I would recommend taking his courses for this class and Congress. If he was teaching other courses at UCLA, I would also take them. This class required a polling group assignment, which was fun to complete with a team and present our research and findings. He is a caring professor and will answer in a timely manner to emails and will go out of his way to schedule office hours with students that are unable to come to his regular office hours. His guidance and answering questions have always been helpful. I recommend taking this course!"
W E Peris,NA,"Electoral Politics: Elections, Media, and Strategy",dummyName,A+,"I thought this was an extremely engaging and worthwhile class. Assignments were all reasonable, especially given that there were no tests. The grade consisted of a few weekly writing assignments (2-3 pg) and then a group polling project that was pretty easy. He cares a lot and shows it while also making the subject extremely accessible."
W E Peris,NA,"Electoral Politics: Elections, Media, and Strategy",dummyName,A," This was one of my favorite classes for the quarter. If you are a Political Science major, you need to take Peris at least once during your time here. The class was easy, but there is a heavier workload than expected. You must sign up for a survey-taking website, write 4 papers on the experiences and relate it back to course material. In addition, there is no final exam, but you do need to conduct your own survey as a final project. You have to work in a group of 3, and while the professor does not walk you through making charts and graphs and using Google Sheets, he is always available via email if you have any questions or concerns. The other nice thing about this class is that the professor encourages students to speak up and engage in his lecture. This makes the class feel more like a collaborative discussion than a monotone lecture. He starts every class by asking if there's anything in the news to discuss, and students can talk about anything that interests them. Public opinion is a subject that I only knew little about, but after taking this course I have a much better understanding of how important it is for the field I want to go into. If you like more hands-on application in terms of homework and project assignments, then this is a class you need to first pass!"
Paul Gregory Nagle,NA,Overview of Contemporary Television Industry,dummyName,A," This class is AWESOME! Take it if you can! The ONLY downside is that the class is from 7-10pm on a Thursday night. Every class has 1 or 2 guests and they just talk and there's a break in between.The T.A.'s have a sign up sheet most of the classes because attendance was like 10% of the grade. The 2 group papers (8 pages and 4 pages) are relatively very easy and easily graded (he doesn't hand grades back until like week 9 but you can email him with questions and he LOVES to help).The final was an in-class written paper (can be typed too) about ONE very broad question you choose from 5, about one of the books he assigns (so you really don't have to do/buy the books except for the ONE you choose). The class before the final he says the 5 different questions that will be in the exam. From the three books, one is a super extra long academic essays one which i do not recommend even purchasing, and the other 2 are shorter and more exciting to read. Choose and buy ONLY ONE of the two books. The food network one is the best and the question from the final didn't even rely on the reading but reading it helps (the question was like DO YOU THINK THE FOOD NETWORK HAS A FUTURE IN THIS COMPETITIVE TV BUSINESS?) That was it... Take this class, it is fun and an easy A, and take your laptop every class because you never know how boring the guest speaker is so a computer will be the only entertainment source you'll have for 3 hours. CLASS SYLLABUS: COURSE OBJECTIVEThe course will serve to examine the evolving economic structures and business practices in the contemporary television industry across a broad spectrum of content delivery services, programming genres, participating companies and contributing individuals.Drawing upon the experiences and insights of distinguished industry professionals who will appear as guests and selected readings from academic, popular and trades sources, students will come to understand and appreciate the fundamental histories, change factors, pending issues and speculative projections that are shaping and re-shaping the contemporary television landscape.In doing so, students will learn analytical skills useful for the study of any media marketplace and become more insightful and informed consumers of television content.For students with career aspirations in the entertainment industry, the course seeks to both prepare and inspire them in pursuit of that goal. For students whose futures lie elsewhere, the course seeks to impart upon them analytical, organizational and creative tools and experiences that will enrich and reward them in any post-graduate, occupational or academic pursuit. TA SECTIONAL SEMINARSIn a very late development, the Department has received University approval for the creation of a weekly Teaching Assistant-led “Sectional”, as a means of supporting and amplifying the lecture and reading content of the course and providing an additional resource for the various assignments. As this development came very close to the commencement of the quarter, details regarding its scheduling are TBD. GUEST SPEAKERSThroughout the course, guest speakers from the highest levels of their respective facet of the industry will share their expertise in all areas of television, such as studio operations, made-for- TV movies, television advertising sales, casting, executive producing and “showrunning”, research, reality and non-fiction programming, among many others. These appearances are designed to be both interactive and skewed towards those themes that are explored in our readings and lectures. FTV 184B – Syllabus – Fall 2017Speakers are subject to availability and may – and often do – change at the last minute owing to the unpredictable nature of the business. GRADINGGrading for this course consists of three elements: Class Participation, which includes regular attendance and thoughtful and productive contributions to class discussions, and two group projects—a Midterm Group Research Paper, and a Final Group Paper + Final Individual “Essay- ette”. The grade breakdown is as follows:Class Participation 30%Midterm Project (Parts 1 & 2) 50% Final 20%Please note the somewhat unconventional allocation for grade determination. The greatest value of this course is the information received via lectures and our industry guest appearances -- in particular, the latter. It is extremely important that students attend every session, particularly as the class meets only once a week. Yes, it is unusual that the Mid-term Project should count for so much more than the Final. The reason for that is that is, frankly, the Mid- term Project is more challenging and more work than the Final and that the Mid-term lays the necessary foundation for the Final Project.Because of this unconventional allocation, the schedule for the Mid-term is shifted relative to the norm: The Mid-Term, Part 1 will be due on November 16th (Week 7). The Midterm, Part 2 will be due on November 30th (Week 9). The Final will be during the last regular class session, December 1st.THERE IS NO CLASS ON NOVEMBER 23TH – HAPPY THANKSGIVING ONE AND ALL ASSIGNED READING FTV 184B – Syllabus – Fall 2017       Lotz, Amanda D., ""THE TELEVISION WILL BE REVOLUTIONIZED"", New York: New York University Press, 2nd Edition, 2014 (selected excerpts only – which will be provided periodically)Salkin, Allen, ""FROM SCRATCH : INSIDE THE FOOD NETWORK"", New York : Putnum, 2013 or revised edition, Berkeley Press, 2014.As to the Salkin book, please plan on reading one chapter per week to remain current. This task should not be looked upon with trepidation; it’s a very readable and entertaining tale with ASSIGNMENTS MIDTERM, PART 1: “THE PIVOT POINT OR ‘EXTREME MAKEOVER – NETWORKEDITION’”8-12 pagesDue Week 7 (November 16th, 2017)As a means of considering a wide range of issues confronting contemporary broadcast and cable networks, student groups will be assigned a specific network that has a historic “pivot point” in its lifespan that redefined its place in the contemporary television landscape. Students will be asked to identify the “pivot point”, justify its selection and provide an explanation of some of the consequences of the pivot.Students will work in groups of 2-3, and each group will profile a different network, both to be determined by random selection.In providing both a guide and context for the identification of “the pivot”, the paper should include some reference to five basic areas of inquiry: Network Ownership and Financial Foundation, Programming Strategy, Marketing Strategy, Program Ownership and Financing, and Signature Show.Please note: Not every one of these questions need be answered in detail in the paper, although most of them will. Consider the following as both a guide for your research as well as a prospective checklist for content.The answer to many of these questions may change as the result of your designation of the respective “pivot point” for your network -- which is precisely the goal of the exercise many relevancies to the course content. I daresay that it might prove to be the most enjoyable reading assignment of any of your classes this quarter.Wolff, Michael, “TELEVISION IS THE NEW TELEVISION: THE UNEXPECTED TRIUMPH OF OLD MEDIA IN THE DIGITAL AGE”, New York: Portfolio/Penguin, 2015A very au courant thesis from one of the wisest and wittiest of our contemporary media sages. Mr. Wolff’s tome will help initiate and provoke some of our most interesting discussions.In addition, there will be various articles or book excerpts on a range of topics handed out each week in class (or sent to the students via PDF).1. Network Ownership and Financial FoundationThis area of inquiry should address, among others, such questions as:a. Who owns the network? Is it part of a conglomerate? Is it a publicly traded company, and if so, how does its ownership affect the type of programming and pressures placed upon the network?b. How does this network fit into the Owner’s overall business strategy?c. What other television interests does the Owner have, and how do they impact thenetwork?d. Where in its lifespan is the network currently? Is it mature, or is it an emergingstartup venture? Is it transitioning into something new, with a new identity?e. What is/are the revenue source(s) for the network? Advertising? Cable systemoperator fees (aka, retransmission fees)? Subscription fees?2. Programming StrategyThis area of inquiry should address the network’s programming objectives and the strategy it is currently using to achieve them. Such questions to pose might include:a. What percentage of programming is original, as opposed to acquired? Is the percentage of original programming increasing?b. What is the target audience these programs endeavor to reach? What is the age, gender, and ethnic breakdown for their audience? Does the programming attempt to evolve the demographic profile over time?c. Is the network’s schedule consistent from night to night, or are there varied strategies employed on different nights?3. Marketing StrategyIn the increasingly crowded and competitive television landscape, networks devote enormous resources towards marketing themselves and their programs. An understanding of a network’s marketing strategy is as critical to the success of a producer’s show as a programming strategy. This area of inquiry might touch upon such topics as:a. Does the network have a “brand,” and if so, how would it be defined?b. From your observations, what is the principal venue for the network’s marketing efforts? Do they use print media, broadcast media, outdoor (i.e. branding at sportsarenas, billboards), or on-air promotional spots—or a combination of these?c. Does the network have an internet presence that is distinctive and complementary?4. Program Ownership and FinancingA critical issue for networks and producers alike relates to the ownership and financing of original programs. This area of inquiry should address such questions as:a. How are the shows financed? (Note: Instructor will assist in directing students to necessary reference source if this question proves frustrating)b. Who owns the show after its network run? Does the producer have the right to distribute the show in other marketplaces, foreign or domestic? Do home video and Video On-Demand services factor into the equation?c. Is the production infrastructure handled in-house at the network or by an outside studio or production company?5. Signature ShowMany networks became household names owing to the prominence of one “signature” show with which the network is closely associated. These shows may help define the “brand” of the network. Identify a show, either scripted or unscripted, that would be representative of the network’s programming strategy, i.e., a “Signature Show” that best illustrates the “Pivot Point”. MIDTERM, PART 23-4 Page Paper Due Week 9 (November 30th, 2017)Working in the same groups as for the Midterm, prepare a short paper that provides a more detailed examination of the show used to illustrate the “Pivot Point”(For those familiar with the series Biography, first made famous on the old A&E Network, this assignment can be likened to researching the “biography” of a television show.)Using 3-4 pages, discuss the following questions:a. Where did the show come from?b. How did it come into being?c. Who thought of it? Who are the producers?d. Is this a pre-existing show or created/developed originally?e. Who directed the pilot? Who wrote the pilot?f. What does the show cost to produce?g. How frequently do episodes air? How many comprise a season?h. How long has the show been on air? How has it evolved over time, both in thequality of the storytelling and of the creative arts (cinematography, production design, lighting, etc.)?FINAL(Inclass. Dependingonhowtheindustryguestscheduleplaysout,theFinalwillbe given either on Week 10, December 7 – Pearl Harbor Day – or during Finals week proper, on December 14).Each student will be assigned a relatively brief (two to three pages) essay that addresses a question derived from one statement in the Amanda Lotz or Michael Wolff assigned textbook. Students will be assigned different questions, which can come from any part of the assignedreading. The essay can be handwritten or typed and emailed in class. P.S. By the end of the class you will all know much more than is necessary to write this little piece."
Paul Gregory Nagle,NA,Overview of Contemporary Television Industry,dummyName,A," Professor Nagle is awesome.  Lecture is once a week for 3 hours.  He typically lectured for an hour then brought in a guest to speak with us.  Guests were from all over the entertainment industry and were happy to answer our questions. The only negative to the class is that 50% of the grade is the midterm, a research paper on the history of a network that he assigns.  He will go out of his way to help you find all of the information you need, including putting you in contact with people who work at that network for a phone interview if need be.  He will also read your paper and provide feedback if you submit it to him early enough.  It's just a matter of having a group that is punctual and gets the paper done early enough. 30% of the grade is attendance.  Just show up and sign in The last 20% is the final, part of which is a short group paper on a show from the network you researched.  The other part is an in class essay based on the reading he assigned. It's an easy class and you'll learn a lot about the entertainment industry.  If you're interested in an entertainment career, take this class."
Paul Gregory Nagle,NA,Overview of Contemporary Television Industry,dummyName,A,"I loved Prof. Nagle's class – super straightforward and manageable, and the weekly industry guests were great. Pretty standard grading with participation, midterm and a final, but I took a lot of positive things away from this class and would take other classes with him in the future."
